Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design of the remote control .
firstly , the group got acquainted with each other by drawing their favourite animals on the white board .
then , project manager introduced the selling price goal of twenty five euros and profit aim of fifty million euro .
the team agreed to sell this internationally and hoped to make a profit of twelve million euros .
after that , they discussed the user requirements , including water resistant , strong and furry .
they also decided to use the telly as a screen .
--------------------
topk:
user .
and then use the telly as a screen .
and working design .
marketing , right .
um .
they 're graceful .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
so we 'll be working on the user requirements , um yeah .
marketing .
but like mobile phones have screens and they 're cheap .
yeah , yeah .
here we go .
welcome everybody .
um , i 'm abigail claflin .
you can call me abbie .
's see .
powerpoint , that 's not it .
there we go .
so this is our kick off meeting .
um and i guess we should all get acquainted .
let 's shall we all introduce ourselves ?
oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
i was thinking that too .
i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer .
yeah .
both .
yeah .
that 's me .
uh , user interface design .
so i 'm thinking we should design a remote control that 's water resistant , strong and furry .
what do you think , yeah ?
this is { disfmarker } the working design is the structure .
a dolphin .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager invites teammates to brainstorm animal characteristics on remote control function and suggest a reflection on user experience to improve technical function design .
price goal is 25 euro , profit aim is fifty million euro , and sales goal is four million .
to summarize , the function design will be user-friendly and practical , in which the technical function will be portable phone based , hand-sized , light with limited but all-functioned buttons .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought they should design a remote control that was water resistant , strong and furry .
user interface thought dolphins were cool because they were smart and cute and they like swimming and that 's cool .
industrial designer thought dogs were easy to draw and slept all day .
marketing thought animals were pretty and went well with the environment .
and he liked the way they ran and felt under the hand .
he used to do horse riding .
the group agreed that a cat would be graceful and sleek .
they also liked its tail because it had a fin on top .
--------------------
topk:
that would be cool .
and furry .
they 're graceful .
but anyway i will do that .
um , and the main reason is they 're pretty .
i think they 're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and i like the way they run and i used to do horse riding and they 're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals .
and i like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , i think that 's pretty much it .
um { disfmarker } um , no , i think dolphins are really uh i dunno , they 're smart and they they 're cute and they like swimming and that 's cool , like { disfmarker } yeah they 're sleek a dolphin .
user .
yeah , i guess it has a fin on top too , yeah .
it 's my dolphin .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
yeah he he does n't look that smart .
he 's a i dunno um they 're i think it 's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they 're like oh look there 's dolphins and it 's kinda like but they 're you know they jump around in the water and they 're happy and they 're mammals , but they swim .
{ vocalsound } so i 'm thinking we should design a remote control that 's water resistant , strong and furry .
what do you think , yeah ?
this is { disfmarker } it 's a cat .
{ vocalsound } a horse .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
i like its tail .
something like that .
i do n't know .
they sleep all day , they 're easy to draw .
and working design .
oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface and industrial designer drawn dolphin and pig , which the two animals have smart and easy-to-draw features .
marketing suggested a horse and project manager thought they should design a remote control that 's water resistant , strong and furry .
also he mentioned that remote control will be priced at 25 euros and aimed to earn a revenue of fifty million euros .
therefore , project manager encouraged teammates to reflect on experience when designing its function and format .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface suggested a call button on the television to be able to find the remote control .
project manager thought that it would be cool if they could design something like this so that users could know where their tv was , because they always knew where it was .
user interface also suggested that the working design has also to do with the physical design , like just the way it looks , and it should be possible to have some kind of a screen or a hand held control in case the tv is lost .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
user .
i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer .
that would be cool .
yeah .
and even i think a little light .
um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing .
i dunno but someth because it 's usually under the sofa .
user interface designer .
so that 's gon na be more technical .
i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w i was thinking that too .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
marketing .
or like you h you see those you know people i 'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it 's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , i do n't know if it must be it would probably { disfmarker } oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
so f that 's a fifty percent um uh .
um , i do n't know what these mean because i did n't actually make the slide-show .
experience with remote control .
so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .
um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
that 's me .
uh , user interface design .
i mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
so we 'll be working on the user requirements , um yeah .
i think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you i mean you always know where your tv is , so just have a call button , yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design .
so i guess you 'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing .
the something , what is the u_i_ ?
marketing , right .
um .
i guess they would go together somehow ?
i dunno .
--------------------
Ref:
the initial feature suggested by marketing was easy to find and user interface suggested a call button on the television .
and marketing wanted something that could vibrate or had a signal if it had no sound .
however , they were not sure whether it is expensive to design it .
so project manager suggested designing a magnet or portable phone based couch for the remote control , which people no need to walk over the tv to find it .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface suggested that the remote control should be hand-sized .
project manager thought it would be better if it had a magnet on the back of it so that it could have some place to put it besides a base .
industrial designer agreed and suggested two million buttons .
user interface then proposed that they should n't have too many buttons , but they could make it bigger if they had to see how much that would cost .
after that , they discussed the size of the buttons and came to a consensus that five minutes was enough .
--------------------
topk:
hand-sized .
i also think though that it should n't have too many buttons , user .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
marketing , right .
um .
that 's me .
uh , user interface design .
two million .
they 're graceful .
marketing .
i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer .
bigger .
and working design .
okay .
so what do we think this remote control should five minutes .
or like you h you see those you know people i 'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it 's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , i do n't know if it must be it would probably { disfmarker } what was the word ?
what if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .
you know like a portable phone has a base , i mean we 'll have to see how much that would be .
so f that 's a fifty percent um uh .
um , i do n't know what these mean because i did n't actually make the slide-show .
experience with remote control .
so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .
um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager asked if the remote control needed to be made larger to avoid losing it .
at the first beginning , user interface suggested bigger , while project manager suggested a hand-sized device .
considering the light feature and putting noise on it , user interface thought it would be feasible to make it mobile with a target price at 25 euros .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought that the cost of the telly screen with the programming function would be too expensive .
they had to remember their budget of twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device .
so they would have to see how much they could cut down on the number of buttons in the remote control to make it cost-effective .
in addition , they needed to find a place to put the call button besides a base .
a portable phone has a screen and they 'll be cheap enough .
--------------------
topk:
marketing .
that would be cool .
but , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
water resistant .
i do n't know if it 's expensive maybe to { disfmarker } because , i do n't know if it 's i think it 's e expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly 's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , user .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
so f that 's a fifty percent um uh .
um , i do n't know what these mean because i did n't actually make the slide-show .
experience with remote control .
so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .

what if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .
you know like a portable phone has a base , i mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
i mean we 'll have to see how much that would be .
but like mobile phones have screens and they 're cheap .
yeah , in in the couch .
um .
we should probably start wrapping up , um we 've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .
um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes .
um .
so .
yeah .
the industrial designer , what does that stand for , i_d_ ,
--------------------
Ref:
since user interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control , so project manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have .
and user interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses .
however , user interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature , but marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range .
so , project manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager suggested having a clip on the back of the remote control so that users could clip it to their television sets .
industrial designer objected to this idea , arguing that it would be like playing pictionary .
project manager went on to explain that the working design has also to do with the physical feat like just the way it looks and functions .
user interface designer agreed and suggested that a call button could be put on television to find the clip .
marketing then proposed that they could talk about their aims at the moment and then discuss business later .
--------------------
topk:
that would be cool .
marketing .
maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your { disfmarker } um .
we should probably start wrapping up , um we 've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .
um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes .
um .
so .
yeah .
the industrial designer , what does that stand for , i_d_ , user .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design .
so i guess you 'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing .
the something , what is the u_i_ ?
so f that 's a fifty percent um uh .
um , i do n't know what these mean because i did n't actually make the slide-show .
experience with remote control .
so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .
um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
or like you h you see those you know people i 'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it 's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , i do n't know if it must be it would probably { disfmarker } oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
's like playing pictionary .
what if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .
you know like a portable phone has a base , but , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
maybe something didn does n't make your hands sweat lot .
like just to have a home for it .
user interface designer .
so that 's gon na be more technical .
i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w hi i 'm chiara , i 'm the um marketing expert .
um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface reiterated that the remote control should have a robust and water resistant function .
marketing also mentioned a good tactile feel for the remote control function , which does n't make hand sweat a lot .
therefore , project manager suggested a clip feature on the remote control so that people can clip it to their device .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager introduced the project plan , which included selling price goal of twenty five euros and profit aim of fifty million euros .
the group agreed to sell the product internationally and hoped to make a profit of twelve fifty euros per unit .
in order to achieve the profit goal , the team would have to set a revenue target of four million .
industrial designer then proposed to design a call button on the television to be able to find the remote control .
user interface followed with the idea of designing a pictionary keypad .
--------------------
topk:
user .
marketing , right .
um .
that would be cool .
okay .
um so f here 's our agenda for today .
um we 're gon na do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
um so .
so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
and to do this , we have to um there 's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .
so .
we 'll get to that .
oh there it is .
right .
functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
so throughout our next couple of meetings we 'll we 'll be covering these things .
um so we 're gon na try out our white board .
if we 'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
okay .
and working design .
marketing .
i 'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer .
oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
sorry about that .
okay .
so moving on .
our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .
so i 'm guessing that we 're not actually in scotland , we 're in some european country .
um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
i 'm krista and i 'm the industrial designer .
that 's me .
uh , user interface design .
so f that 's a fifty percent um uh .
um , i do n't know what these mean because i did n't actually make the slide-show .
experience with remote control .
so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control .
um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
two million .
yeah .
both .
yeah .
's like playing pictionary .
hi i 'm chiara , i 'm the um marketing expert .
um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
well it 's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that 'll do four million .
any volunteers ?
four million .
and it { disfmarker } what was the word ?
yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
--------------------
Ref:
the selling price goal is 25 euros and profit aim is fifty million euros .
selling target is four million and the profit goal is fifty percent .
so project manager mentioned that the group hopes to sell the remote control device internationally , instead of in scotland or some european country .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about evaluating the prototype of the remote control project .
firstly , project manager gave a presentation on the basic idea of their prototype , including the price , the number of items and the sum .
then , marketing , user interface and industrial designer gave their presentations , respectively .
marketing emphasized that the most important function is easy to use , channel switching , volume , zapping , and channel flipping , but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
after that , they discussed the choice of components and found that they could be creative , leaving out the solar cells and voice recognition feature .
they also decided to discard the special form .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
okay .
um you had an overall rating .
um { disfmarker } in interesting design .
and uh m maximise the profits that 's the basic idea , yeah .
of our prototype .
so we could we we could be we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative .
no , we are evaluating this this uh design now .
this prototype .
and the buttons ?
if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes .
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
okay .
let 's wrap it up .
that would have been a thrill .
with with grey or black .
that 's about it .
well the p the most important function is easy to use .
the the zapping , channel switching , volume .
but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
the remote control offers enough features .
and uh maybe not use the special form .
it was a privilege working with you .
{ vocalsound } to digitise them .
--------------------
Ref:
this is the fourth meeting of the design group .
the group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting .
then project manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget , they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells , not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics .
then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product .
they thought the remote control should be fancy , innovative , easy to use , easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria .
when evaluating the project , the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price .
eventually , the group decided to redesign the product .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager asked the team to evaluate the remote control on three criteria .
the price , the number of items and the sum of the features .
industrial designer thought it was not very expensive , but project manager pointed out that there were remote controls which control stereo , television , dv_d , cd player , for under twenty five euros .
user interface agreed and gave a two-point scale from one to five .
after that , marketing gave an average score of three and a half , which was high enough for the product to win the award .
--------------------
topk:
but it 's not that fancy .
and a button for disabling the voice recognition .
is it easy to use ?
no , or the other way around .
the basic okay .
okay .
um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
in interesting design .
that would have been a thrill .
they 're out there .
{ vocalsound } okay .
um you had an overall rating .
um { disfmarker } no , bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
and w well , just give it a two .
so we could we we could be we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
that 's about it .
so um yeah , th this design is not um within our price model .
well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
the remote control offers enough features .
so it 's it 's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to .
and this is quite s simple .
--------------------
Ref:
the group thought the remote control should be fancy , innovative , easy to use , easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria .
although they had brilliant ideas and designed a best remote control within their capacity , they just designed a product of high quality but low acceptance .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought the remote control was easy to use for both types of users .
for a novice user , it would be easier for him to understand how to change channels and change the volume , while for more advanced users , such a user would like to explore all the additional functions .
in that way it is advanced .
user interface agreed and thought it was an interesting design .
project manager thought ease of use did not only apply to the most basic functions but also to advanced ones as well .
there are remote controls which control stereo , television , dvd , cd player , for under twenty five euros .
--------------------
topk:
and i think it 's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
okay .
uh two or three ?
three ?
wha wh what would be your guess ?
i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions .
well , but there are two parts in this remote control .
what you see here is is the basic part .
everybody can use it , so that 's easy to use .
so , in the in { disfmarker } but uh we do n't uh we do n't uh we do think it 's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
well the p the most important function is easy to use .
the the zapping , channel switching , volume .
but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder .
so i could make it e easy ?
they n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it 's easier for them no , or the other way around .
bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
yes .
yes , but you can you c yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
in interesting design .
it 's it 's quite easy .
that 's for a novice user .
when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .
so in that in that way it is advanced , and a button for disabling the voice recognition .
it 's important .
uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve .
um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .
and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .
but other users who are new to this device need something like that .
it it most definitely is it 's very easy .
i know , but we could n't use that feature , yes , it is .
so { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
user interface believed that voice recognition was hard to learn while industrial designer argued that the remote control had two parts and everyone could use the basic part .
he also pointed out that an advanced user would like to explore additional functions .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that the remote control was competitive in the evaluation criteria because there were already remote controls which control stereo , television , dvd , c_d player , for under twenty five euros .
however , project manager pointed out that they were paying for the brand , so they had to maximise the profits .
industrial designer thought it was not very expensive for a new product that had this functionality .
user interface thought the selling price would be 25 euros , which was within the budget .
marketing agreed .
--------------------
topk:
well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
in interesting design .
bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
it has to do with fashion , i guess .
the prices .
divided by four .
and a button for disabling the voice recognition .
it should be .
yeah , like this one .
and the buttons ?
no , or the other way around .
with with grey or black .
that 's a flavour as well .
yes .
yes , but you can you c yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .
yes , it is .
yay .
is it ?
is it fancy ?
and uh m maximise the profits so uh selling price uh would be uh { disfmarker } so , in the in { disfmarker } it was a privilege working with you .
{ vocalsound }
--------------------
Ref:
marketing thought that the basic layout was mundane but the voice recognition was brilliant .
user interface added that it did not have the digits but had all the features a normal remote control had .
industrial designer agreed but pointed out that they just design the best product within their capacity .
project agreed and concluded that it was of high quality but low acceptance .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case , but they decided not to because they could not use solar .
project manager thought the choice of components and the price were tempered by the high quality of the material .
user interface thought plastic or rubber would be better for the product because it was more durable .
marketing thought grey or black or something like that would cost the least .
industrial designer agreed that it would not be very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
the prices .
but w um we were n't aware of the prices of the costs .
grey or black or something like that .
whatever cost uh cost uh the least .
{ vocalsound } plastic or rubber .
so we could we we could be we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
so i think it 's worth its price .
bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
it 's still too expensive , yeah .
um { disfmarker } well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
that would have been a thrill .
so high quality , low acceptance .
and the buttons ?
i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .
it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .
yeah , yes , it 's more than fifty euros .
it 's quite expensive , yes .
that 's about it .
yes , rubber ?
yeah , it 's it 's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty .
uh twenty five .
and costs were twelve fifty .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager revealed that it would cost 22 euros at current standards so they should leave out some characteristics that could not add much value .
since it could be dull and simple without those characteristics , the group supposed that the selling price could be raised to 50 euros .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it would have been fancier by using the double-curved case , but they decided not to because they could not use solar cells .
project manager agreed that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price .
user interface thought their production cost would be exceeded by double if they used the voice recognition feature .
marketing thought the cost of the remote control could be reduced by reducing the number of buttons .
industrial designer agreed and proposed to use grey or black or something like that .
--------------------
topk:
the prices .
yeah , well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
so we could we we could be we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case .
it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .
that would have been a thrill .
but w um we were n't aware of the prices of the costs .
grey or black or something like that .
whatever cost uh cost uh the least .
{ vocalsound } and the buttons ?
yes , rubber ?
no , or the other way around .
in interesting design .
and w it 's still too expensive , yeah .
um { disfmarker } no , but even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double , think .
production cost was were t uh was twenty two ?
if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes .
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , okay ,
--------------------
Ref:
project manager revealed that it would be over budget so they had to make some changes .
he proposed to reduce costs by leaving out solar cells and not using voice recognition .
then user interface supposed that the buttons could be made of plastics and industrial designer proposed to make the remote control straight and simple .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer pointed out that it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality .
however , there was little added value in an enhanced case with dull functions .
the choice of components was too narrow and the price too high .
in the end , industrial designer proposed to change the casing to grey or black or something like that .
whatever cost cost the least , it would be worth it for the creativity of the product and maximise the profits of customers .
project manager agreed and agreed to make the change .
--------------------
topk:
that would have been a thrill .
bu but well yeah , i know , but you 're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .
well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
and uh m maximise the profits so we could we we could be we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
but w um we were n't aware of the prices of the costs .
so i think it 's worth its price .
the prices .
in interesting design .
it 's still too expensive , yeah .
um { disfmarker } so and uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow .
yeah , it 's it 's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty .
and a button for disabling the voice recognition .
yes , it 's more than fifty euros .
it 's quite expensive , yes .
so there was not really a process of uh { disfmarker } it 's important .
uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve .
um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .
and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often .
but other users who are new to this device need something like that .
the process was good .
well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because i think there 's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions .
if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes .
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , grey or black or something like that .
whatever cost uh cost uh the least .

Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control .
firstly , marketing , user interface and industrial designer gave a presentation on the market trends and market research results .
then , project manager led a discussion on properties , materials and user-interface and trend-watching .
in the end , the team decided to leave out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
they were also going to look into rechargeable batteries , rubber material and incorporating the company logo .
--------------------
topk:
and incorporating the company logo ?
and g graphic user interface right um this is our conceptual design meeting , okay .
the rubber .
this is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ?
a remote control , like , and then be able to touch that for the other controls , the eternal battle for control of the controls .
maybe we could start with the black and white .
okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
after lunch .
yeah .
that could be a good idea .
sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
yeah but then again so the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .
all are confusing and in inconsistent .
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .
we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .
rubber , yeah .
--------------------
Ref:
after a brief summary of the last meeting , the team discussed the conceptual design for new remote control , which covered the properties , materials , user interface and trend watching .
marketing shared feedback about the design of the device .
industrial designer gave a presentation on the design and availability of actual components , whereas user interface led the discussion about customer needs and feasibility on design and competitors ' study .
a final decision was reached regarding the design of the remote control such as using kinetic charging and a rubber cover .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team decided to leave out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
they were also going to look into the rechargeable batteries and incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
the rubber casing would be made of fruit and vegetable colours and the anti-rsi ones .
in the end , the team reached a consensus to use double a or triple a batteries because they still got to be charged this way , and kinetic charging was not feasible .
--------------------
topk:
so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , and they 've got in stock , so yeah .
well they do , i think the only they can t on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-r_s_i_ ones .
and incorporating the company logo ?
a remote control , like , the feel .
okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
okay .
the rubber .
thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .

so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
for the decisions that we 've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um lcd display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we 're gon na use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .
that 's how far we 've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
and g graphic user interface so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a_ or triple a_ batteries 'cause they 've still got to be charged this way have n't they ?
sort of beige and black also the { disfmarker } just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
--------------------
Ref:
kinetic charging will be adopted with lcd display on the top side of the flip top and rubberized buttons , such as volume control and channel control on the bottom .
two separate circuit boards will be joined by wires for standard and complex buttons respectively .
fruit and vegetable colours , such as chilli red or tomato red will be used for the rubber cover and the case will be plastic .
the company logo will be incorporated into the design .
the team hoped to incorporate voice recognition but financial feasibility will have to be checked and whistles or beepers could be used if not feasible .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team decided to leave out the voice recognition , a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
they were going to look into the rechargeable batteries , the rubber casing for the plastic shell and incorporating the image of the company into it somehow .
in addition , they would use a lcd screen instead of a bare pcb circuit board and they could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of array and you could have them like a touch screen .
there would also be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials in contrast to last year .
--------------------
topk:
so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
that could be a good idea .
okay .
the rubber .
and incorporating the company logo ?
a remote control , like , and they 've got in stock , so yeah .
and g graphic user interface it 's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think , okay .
so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .
well they do , okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
we could use the body , they can t 'kay .
mm-hmm .
is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy .
is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , so the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .
all are confusing and in inconsistent .
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .

we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
--------------------
Ref:
teletext will not be used and there will not be a control for everything .
the buttons should be easy to find .
the image of the company is to be incorporated in the design and a flip design is decided .
voice recognition is left out .
the shape of the remote will be different than normal , like a shell or something along those lines .
an alarm will be added in case the remote is lost .
the target market will be young business people .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface suggested that the remote control should be made of plastic with a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
industrial designer thought that double a and triple a were too bulky at the moment and dynamo charging was a bit silly .
project manager agreed and suggested rechargeable batteries .
user interface also suggested rubber buttons on the top to keep frequently changing the channels and repetitive buttons which were like volume or channel changing and all could be on pointing device , that means the user did not need to use a pointer .
--------------------
topk:
well they do , okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
a remote control , like , so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
okay .
the rubber .
thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , i 'm no i 'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that 's what they said .
um the problem with the casing is that uh there 's quite um there 's quite a few design restrictions that they 've got on the shape of the case .
if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .
but whether whether or not because we 'd have it in two separate units sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
that could be a good idea .
they can t and incorporating the company logo ?
there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .
so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .
okay and then { disfmarker } but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .
like , some some people have a here you see this ?
this is on a i i i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries also the { disfmarker } the eternal battle for control of the controls .
--------------------
Ref:
market research was done with a hundred subjects and marketing concluded the most important aspect required in the device is a fancy look and feel .
the second and third important aspects are technologically innovative and being easy to use .
fruits and vegetables can be taken into consideration when thinking about design themes as they were the themes of fashion fairs in paris and milan .
there is also a trend towards a spongy feel to materials .

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer pointed out that there was no rechargeable option available , so the standard double a and triple a would be too bulky at the moment , and dynamo charging might be a bit silly .
project manager also mentioned that calculators have a battery in them as well , but they are easy to replace as they 're cheap .
in terms of the material used in the remote control , industrial designer proposed to use rubber buttons which are anti-r s i.e .
users would n't be pressing down on them .
--------------------
topk:
they can t do you want like a back-up ?
has to be solar .
but do n't calculators have a battery in them as well ?
you do get a bit of wear so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ .
um , findings , i 've got my nice little picture there .
this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment .
and g graphic user interface did it ?
they 're easy to replace as well , cheap .
i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , plastic , 'kay .
mm-hmm .
is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy .
is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , things like that , a remote control , like , sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .

um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
i 'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
that 's going to { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer explained that ta11835 is a chip used in pretty much every remote control to send out standard signals based on the input .
on the other hand , most current remotes use a silicone printed circuit board ( pcb board ) which connects the circuits so that the messages would be sent to the chip .
the size should be decided as the board can be custom made .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer pointed out that there was no rechargeable option available , so the standard double a and triple a batteries were too bulky at the moment and dynamo charging was a bit silly .
in addition , titanium was very expensive just to process , and it would detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature , which was the selling point of a flip phone .
besides , the kinetic ones were easy to replace as well , cheap and easily lost , while the whistle-like ones could get lost easily .
--------------------
topk:
but i i think they could get a bit easily lost , for l yeah , the whistle .
selling point .
there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , has to be solar .
they 're easy to replace as well , cheap .
rubber , yeah .
they can t okay .
the rubber .
k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
i i think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it 's only a tiny amount it 's it 's um it 's always moving for the whole day and they do n't run out over night when you leave them on the side .
oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .
and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical .
titanium um very expensive just to process , for the flip phone .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .

this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment .
--------------------
Ref:
standard aa and aaa are bulky but the cheapest .
dynamo and dual charging with normal batteries and solar charging take up too much space .
solar charging is the second cheapest but not resistant to dropping .
also , project manager believed it would limit the market .
kinetic charging is small and portable but market research should be done first .
no rechargeable battery options were available .
the remote could have a standby mode and the lights behind the buttons would be switched off after five or ten seconds when not in use .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer first proposed to use rubber as the case material .
user interface thought it would be spongy this year , but industrial designer pointed out that rubber was expensive and people would n't be pressing down on it because it was anti-rss .
marketing supplemented that they could use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , which was accepted by the group .
then they discussed the material of the main case case housing and decided to make it red , psychedelic , black and white zebra stripes .
--------------------
topk:
um , the case material , i 've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there 's the plastic which i think we were gon na go for anyway as the main case case housing okay .
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ .
rubber , yeah .
mm .
so that affects the exterior design .
is rubber .
mm .
for the decisions that we 've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um lcd display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we 're gon na use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .
that 's how far we 've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
a remote control , like , so , are we looking at voice ?
they can t okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
for l yeah , the whistle .
that could be a good idea .
also the { disfmarker } which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you 're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , um , findings , i 've got my nice little picture there .
this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment .
okay .
the rubber .
solar would be slightly expensives .
--------------------
Ref:
titanium is too expensive , would be easily dented and could only do a standard box shape whereas plastic could be made into different curved shapes .
marketing suggested making the basic mould out of plastic with a rubber cover , which would give a spongy feel and be a cheap way to change the look of the device .
industrial designer , user interface and project manager quickly jumped on board with this idea .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team decided to use a combination of boards , rubber buttons , lcd screens , capacitors , solar cells , palm pop-up thingy , whistle , and voice recognition to design the interface of the remote control .
the circuit board would be a bare pcb , while the buttons could be arranged in a sort of array and the touch screen would make the connection over if they were close enough .
there would also be an integrated speaker , microphone , speaker grille , power source , switch , scroll wheel , etc .
--------------------
topk:
and g graphic user interface so , are we looking at voice ?
a remote control , like , just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen .
not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
for l yeah , the whistle .
has to be solar .
mm .
so that affects the exterior design .
it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
they can t that could be a good idea .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch rubber , yeah .
is rubber .
mm .
so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
like one of the palm pop thing .
okay .
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
okay .
the rubber .
also the { disfmarker } sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
--------------------
Ref:
the team planned to do touch screen and there are two options to choose from , a bare pcb circuit board which could be in different colours and making a connection by the touch of fingers , and anti rsi rubber buttons with a lcd type of screen .
industrial designer doubted whether a lcd screen is wanted as it would only be in black and white but have not thought out how to distinguish where to press if the bare pcb circuit board is used .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested that the team could use a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components .
however , industrial designer pointed out that it would have to be attached to the circuit board , which was not feasible for the flip phone .
user interface disagreed with marketing 's proposal , arguing that users would n't actually need one and would use anything they 've got , such as a pencil or a pen .
project manager agreed and proposed a palm pop thing .
--------------------
topk:
they 're easy to replace as well , cheap .
yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out that could be a good idea .
'cause if you 're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
but there 'd be touch touch buttons , well they do , it would have to be attached .
for l yeah , the whistle .
for the flip phone .
i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ .
is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch a remote control , like , yeah just a thought they would n't actually need one and they could use anything they 've got , could n't they ?
a pencil or a pen , so they would n't really need a { disfmarker } and g graphic user interface they can t 'kay .
mm-hmm .
is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy .

so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , like one of the palm pop thing .
okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer thought it would be lost easily and marketing responded that it would be easy and cheap to replace or a pencil or pen could be used instead .
user interface pointed out that a person who switches channels often or uses a particular function will find it irritating to use and might spoil the touchpad more easily compared to a button .
industrial designer agreed with user interface .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested putting mirrors on the device to respond to the turn of the body .
however , industrial designer pointed out that it would n't cost too much and that the team should think of other features they can build in that would make the remote control more user-friendly , such as having some sort of stylus that users could pull out when they needed to adjust the volume .
project manager agreed and suggested that they could forget about the mirror idea and just use the lcd screen instead .
--------------------
topk:
oh i think forget about the mirror things like that , that could be a good idea .
put it on in that way .
did it ?
but it 's something to put on the side to think about maybe .
okay , uh would like to share something which i did here .
first thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .
second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .
so y you generally see there 's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .
a remote control , like , sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .

so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
for the flip phone .
and they kind of respond to the turn of your body .
is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .
thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .

um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
also the { disfmarker } yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it 'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it 's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager believed that it would not appeal to men as they were unlikely to use it when watching television .
marketing responded by leaving this idea on the side , and industrial designer and project manager agreed .
in the end , marketing gave up on the idea .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer first presented the design of the actual components and the availability of components in stock at the moment .
the main idea was to make the remote control easy to find so that users would just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv .
in this study , the materials that were n't available were rubber , anti-rsi , plastic , titanium , solar cells , rechargeable batteries , and a chip called the t_a double one eight three five which was used in pretty much every remote .
it sends out standard signals based on your input and is used for all all tv remotes .
--------------------
topk:
it would have to be attached .
okay .
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
they 're easy to replace as well , cheap .
on the bottom we were gon na have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-r_s_i_ ones .
on the lower side .
okay .
the rubber .
they can t also the { disfmarker } and they 've got in stock , so yeah .
so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ .
rubber , yeah .
well they do , a remote control , like , sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
um , findings , i 've got my nice little picture there .
this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment .
is rubber .
mm .
so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , has to be solar .
--------------------
Ref:
the chip ta11835 and pcb board will be used in the device .
the use of kinetic charging was agreed by the team with a standby mode to save battery .
the case of the device would be in plastic and would have a changeable rubber cover .
lcd screens will be adopted .
the idea of adding a stylus or a mirror to the device was rejected .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer proposed that the remote should be in a standby mode while not being used to conserve battery life .
user interface suggested that it could be moulded with the design in such a way that users can change it every time they need to switch the tv on or off .
project manager agreed and proposed a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
they were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just like the normal remote , might not be suitable for the flip phone .
--------------------
topk:
for l yeah , the whistle .
a remote control , like , so , are we looking at voice ?
i mean you switch the tv on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .
okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
sort of beige and black i i think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it 's only a tiny amount it 's it 's um it 's always moving for the whole day and they do n't run out over night when you leave them on the side .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
i 'm no i 'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that 's what they said .
um the problem with the casing is that uh there 's quite um there 's quite a few design restrictions that they 've got on the shape of the case .
if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .
but whether whether or not because we 'd have it in two separate units so that and then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used .
now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they 've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a tv remote , they 're easy to replace as well , cheap .
like , some some people have a here you see this ?
this is on a i i i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .
so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .
'kay .
mm-hmm .
is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy .
is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv .
and most people most people also watch tv in the in the night anyway .
for the flip phone .
--------------------
Ref:
mostly black and white colours , the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models , and the buttons are very disorganized .
the new remote will have a graphic user interface in the middle of the flip top and certain standard buttons with vibrant fruit colours .
a newly developed speech recognition feature can be incorporated in the device and the idea was endorsed by customers .
user interface gave an example of using the feature - locating the remote .
the idea was well-received by the team .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested that the speech recognition feature could be adopted to cut down the cost of the remote control .
however , industrial designer pointed out that it would depend on the expense of it .
if the feature was adopted , it could cost more than 25 euros , so it might not be feasible for the company to incorporate it at a low cost .
project manager agreed and proposed a flip design and a different shape from what 's normal .
they were also going to look into the rechargeable batteries .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , depending on the expense of it .
so , are we looking at voice ?
has to be solar .
for l yeah , the whistle .
it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much that could be a good idea .
sorry project manager .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .

so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
so the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .
all are confusing and in inconsistent .
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .
we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .
okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .
so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .
be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
okay .
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .
okay , first uh the into the method .
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .
um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available .
so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it .
um the minutes from the last time .
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .
um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal .
we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um .
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries it might { disfmarker } and g graphic user interface thank you .
there we go .
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .
um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , and they 've got in stock , so yeah .
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .

the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does , without that also the { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer said that it would be cheaper to re-manufacture if these parts were already in stock .
project manager pointed out that the other materials used were relatively cheap and simple .
though the lcd would be expensive , it would be cheaper with black and white than full colour so user interface suggested that they could start off with black and white and upgrade later .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced himself and the team members got acquainted with each other and their roles in the project .
then , industrial designer gave a presentation on the industrial design process and set the target price of twelve euros and fifty centimes .
user interface designer designed the user requirement specifications , which included the material , buttons , colour , shape , material and function .
after that , marketing led the discussion on user requirements and suggested that the selling price should be twenty five euros .
finally , the group discussed the function design and decided to make it international .
--------------------
topk:
and uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
i 'm the industrial designer .
as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes .
so , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control .
um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , so really the remote control to be international .
and u_i_d_ , it 's for the user interface designer , so , i 'll present myself , i 'm ada longmund , and as you may know it , i 'm the pr project manager .
so um we will have to um speak about m the project .
our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there 's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .
record .
so the project method is the following .
so if we 're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other .
uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
uh .
i design the user f user interface , you design the function .
i am the industrial design , yeah just have to present project , and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer .
okay , so i make uh u user interface .
i am the industrial designer so .
so i will manage all all the group .
i suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
and the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
and not too expensive .
we have an idea yeah .
{ vocalsound } so which you , the industrial designer .
so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros .
{ vocalsound }
--------------------
Ref:
the meeting , which was held at the early stage of the project , focused on the product features and work division .
project manager proposed that the remote control had to be imaginative , trendy , user-friendly and international .
besides , the production cost should be no more than 12.5 euros .
in terms of the price , all members agreed that 25 euros would be reasonable .
they also clarified each person 's duty .
in the time remaining , the members did some tool training by drawing their favourite animals on the whiteboard .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team agreed that the remote control should be original , trendy and user-friendly .
project manager also proposed to design the industrial way to transform it into a tablet , but this idea was turned down by user interface designer and industrial designer because he thought it would not be suitable for the budget .
the team then decided to make it international and sell it in the entire world , and the product costs would be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes .
besides , they wanted it to be imaginative and easy to use .

industrial designer agreed and asked project manager to work on the design and also to think of the user requirement specifications and think about the technical fun functions in this way as well .
in conclusion , the team agreed to design an original , trendy and user-friendly product with new functionalities that do n't exist now .

product manager { disfmarker } ami yeah project .
yeah , that was the eyes .
i 'm the industrial designer .

the team agreed that the selling price of the remote control would be twenty five euros and fifty centimes , which was within the budget .
they would sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros .

the remote control would be priced at 25 euros and the product cost would be no more than 12.5 euros .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager introduced the work division of the project .
industrial designer was in charge of conceptual design and user interface was responsible for the detailed design of technical fun functions .
functional design was the responsibility of individual work and group work was assigned to the product manager .
project manager expected the remote control to be original , trendy , user-friendly and easy to use .
so the team would have to work with each other to design the technical functions and think of user requirement specifications .
marketing would be the manager 's assistant .

Ref:
project manager would manage the whole group .
industrial designer would think of the functions of the product .
user interface designer would concentrate on the users ' requirement and the relation between the users and the remote control .
marketing would give interface designer and industrial designer some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer believed that user interface designer should design the relation between the user and the remote control so that it would be easy to use and not too expensive .
in addition , industrial designer thought that the manager should be in charge of taking care of the industrial way to transform it into a user-friendly product .
the project manager agreed and added that he would look into this matter further in the next meeting .
besides , the group agreed to have a discussion about the division of tasks among the team members .

i am the industrial design , yeah i i think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so { disfmarker } and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer .
of and uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
user interface design d industrial design ?
{ vocalsound } i_d_ ,
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer thought user interface designer 's job was to focus on the relation between the users and the remote control and decide how the object looks – for example , where the button would be .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer and user interface designer agreed that the remote control should be easy to use and not too expensive .
industrial designer also pointed out that it should not be too complicated to design and that users should only have to worry about the basic functions , such as controlling the volume , the brightness , and the scrolling , instead of the complicated ones like menu navigation and scrolling through the menu menu .
then they discussed the difference between the eyesight and speech recognition and decided to make it a two-fold difference .
--------------------
topk:
i 'm the industrial designer .
yeah , that was the eyes .
so which you , the industrial designer .
i am the industrial design , yeah i am the industrial designer so .
no i 'm user interf i 'm user interface design .
and u_i_d_ , it 's for the user interface designer , so really the remote control to be international .
user interface design d industrial design ?
{ vocalsound } and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer .
i_d_ , i design the user f user interface , you design the function .
so , i 'll present myself , i 'm ada longmund , and as you may know it , i 'm the pr project manager .
so um we will have to um speak about m the project .
our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there 's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .

uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
uh .
okay , so i make uh u user interface .
and not too expensive .
and easy to use .
it will uh be a an international remote control , of product manager { disfmarker } okay .
so what 's the difference between
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer would design the functions and figure out the industrial way to implement it while the user interface designer 's job was to decide how the object looked .
in short , the two were like the inside and the outside .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control .
firstly , marketing , user interface , industrial designer , and project manager gave presentations on the prototype of remote controls .
then , the team got acquainted with each other by drawing their favourite animals on whiteboards .
after that , they discussed the working design process and made a rough plan for the final product .
they decided to make it more like a mobile phone , with a lot of options for users to choose from , such as ipod , bluetooth , lcd screen , etc .
--------------------
topk:
okay .
well uh the components .
i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options .
to make it more like a mobile phone .
more modern .
and show , sorry .
okay , so let 's have a look s at this one .
okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control no , that 's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a tv remote control only .
so have you changed that part ?
and later we can d uh do the design .
but then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be leds .
they do n't like new features .
so maybe not .
which one first ?
yeah , then { disfmarker } yeah , yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .
but uh we also have to stand out , yeah , okay , i told about the home station .
uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it .
and i i found a motto .
and we put the fashion in electronics .
and that 's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style .
we we have to make a a new product .
we have to be um yeah .
one of a kind , i think .
well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .
to { disfmarker } maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like ipod .
uh left .
well , i i use a universal uh remote control , it 's only for you .
--------------------
Ref:
this meeting was about the functional design of the remote control .
firstly , marketing gave a presentation on functional requirements .
group decided to focus on the fancy and fashionable look , usability , and different colors .
next , user interface gave a presentation on the technical function design .
also , the group discussed this topic , and they decided to design the menu buttons of the remote similar to the mobile phone .
then , industrial designer gave a presentation on the working design .
group mates discussed deciding on the use of led light on the buttons to indicate the transmitting of the morse code when pressing the button .
they also decided to use a more intelligent chip than the standard one when the circuit was closed , it would produce the pattern .
for the age group , they would target the age group below forty since it was a young market .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface and marketing gave a presentation on the functional requirements of the remote control .
the team agreed that it should be easy to use and reachable , with a lot of options for users to choose from , such as teletext , bluetooth , lcd display , etc .
they also agreed to make it more like a mobile phone .
then , they discussed how to stand out from the crowd by having a simple design , without too many buttons .
after that , industrial designer and user interface gave an example of how they could incorporate some of their ideas into the design .
--------------------
topk:
functional requirements , yeah to { disfmarker } yeah , i have it on the next page .
everywhere in the r not really .
i use teletext as well .
to make it more like a mobile phone .
more modern .
but uh we also have to stand out , but then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be leds .
but yeah .
yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah .
just on the front as well .
no , that 's the only th the only thing you need .
okay , this was uh my presentation .
which one first ?
it must be around it then .
like uh phones .
i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options .
reachable .
no , or maybe when you { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
marketing gave some suggestions on the remote functional requirements based on marketing reports , which included a fancy look of the remote control , ease of use for elderly people , a button on the home station to trace its position , and speech recognition .
so finally , the group mates suggested the usability and the color of the remote control based on marketing 's presentation .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested giving up on speech recognition because it was not usable in a remote control , especially when you only had tv functions on it .
project manager agreed and pointed out that old people were not looking for that kind of technology anyway .
user interface disagreed and said that it just a n't useful enough .
marketing went on to say that there must be sound in it , so it would have to work only when users used it for tv .
industrial designer agreed with marketing and suggested that they could use questionnaires on the internet .
--------------------
topk:
well i dunno .
but i do n't think , it just ai n't useful enough .
uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition .
we did n't uh think about that already .
and uh an lcd on the remote control .
we already thought about that .
um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features .
and but they 're more critical .
and older people uh want to spend uh more money .
but uh they uh they do n't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they 're in their old uh thinking way .
and they want to keep the old uh things the old things .
{ gap } and i d i do n't do n't think it 's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have tv functions on it .
okay , yeah .
yeah , we can uh combine that .
uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .
uh i think we must t uh take a look at this .
it 's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent .
but it 's uh a tough one .
because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty i think .
uh next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .
yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours tv or something .
i do n't we we have n't uh we must n't look too much at uh the last point .
okay , last page .
but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .
um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .
uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does .
so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .
um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control also the one in the dark .
so uh it lights up when it 's dark ?
yeah , there must be sound in it .
it uh uh it have to work only when you use it .
or maybe when you { disfmarker } okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .
and uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .
so i um i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .
so we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control .
uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .
yeah , i think uh uh that 's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control .
uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .
i think this fits uh at the uh what what uh michael said about uh older people .
older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what 's good .
because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .
well okay , that 's uh normal .
i think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .
but that 's one of our requirements .
so not really .
that should be cool .
but old people are not looking for that .
to { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } no , so we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
yeah , i have it on the next page .
but not sure .
--------------------
Ref:
when marketing mentioned that their target group should be both young people and people above forty who were not keen on new features , marketing thought it would be too expensive to have the speech recognition and not reachable for twenty-five euros .
also , marketing suggested a dvd player , stereo , and vcr for television .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested that the remote control should work only when users use it for a television , dvd player , stereo and vc r. user interface pointed out that there are already many controls out there that support a lot of stuff , so they have to make sure that they stand out by just looks of it .
so make it just a different colour or different shape so that it stands out when people see it in the shop .
marketing also suggested to keep it simple and standard features on all remote controls .
--------------------
topk:
but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .
um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .
uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does .
so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .
um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control i use teletext as well .
okay .
technical functions design .
okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience .
is n't that is n't true anymore .
but um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple .
uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard .
so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .
not too full , like uh jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
and show , sorry .
okay , so let 's have a look s at this one .
okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control no , that 's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a tv remote control only .
so have you changed that part ?
to just keep it simple and standard uh features .
okay , uh now my personal preferences .
uh using the standards , basic um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .
so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .
so when you are in the shop and you see our tv controller hanging , that it stands out .
not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls .
uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh okay , yeah .
yeah , we can uh combine that .
uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .
uh i think we must t uh take a look at this .
it 's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent .
but it 's uh a tough one .
because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty i think .
uh next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .
yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours tv or something .
i do n't we we have n't uh we must n't look too much at uh the last point .
okay , last page .
yeah , that 's uh what i told you .
the remote control should only be used for a television .
so that 's maybe easier .
and um the the forty plus people , i already told you .
oh no , sorry .
oh , this is a problem .
oh sorry about that .
the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .
so it should be flashy or just more interesting .
okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .
and uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .
so i um i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .
so we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control .
uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .
yeah , i think uh uh that 's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control .
uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .
i think this fits uh at the uh what what uh michael said about uh older people .
older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what 's good .
because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .
well okay , that 's uh normal .
i think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .
but that 's one of our requirements .
to find out .
but there is already in a one done .
of functions i could think of .
uh volume , channels , the the basic according to .
just one two three etcetera .
uh text service options .
um basic on-off .
and i found an uh could i think of favourites ?
i always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number .
um then i have my personal uh preference .
okay , that 's not very good , because i thought about television , d_v_d_ player , stereo and v_c_r_ .
i had a question about .
but it 's already out of the question , this .
um my point is , well , i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , i think it 's hard to uh sell it for twenty five euros .
but it 's the exercise .
it uh uh it have to work only when you use it .
and i d i do n't do n't think it 's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have tv functions on it .
so but then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be leds .
for for for my sur um 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .
but we have to make sure that we 're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .
so make it just a different colour or different shape , we definitely should use it .
um { disfmarker } like uh phones .
--------------------
Ref:
when marketing mentioned that they should make a new product that looked fancy , fashionable , and was easy to use for elderly users , user interface suggested making sure that the remote control had better usability and could stand out by just being watched .
also , marketing suggested a different color or different shape .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team agreed that the basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff should be easy to use , and the options that they put on the second level of the remote control should not be too complicated .
for elderly people , they should have more room and big buttons .
an icon on it or text would make it clear what that buttons did .
a way to find out what people use is to ask some random people or take questionnaires .
the team decided to stand out by having a mute button .
--------------------
topk:
to make it more like a mobile phone .
more modern .
yeah , a mute button .
yes .
to { disfmarker } not really .
but yeah .
just very simple .
functional requirements , yeah and show , sorry .
okay , so let 's have a look s at this one .
okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control no , that 's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a tv remote control only .
so have you changed that part ?
yeah , i have it on the next page .
i use teletext as well .
o but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .
because you ne almost never use it .
huh , that 's a good idea .
yeah , that 's uh what i told you .
the remote control should only be used for a television .
so that 's maybe easier .
and um the the forty plus people , i already told you .
oh no , sorry .
oh , this is a problem .
oh sorry about that .
the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .
so it should be flashy or just more interesting .
but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .
um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons .
uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does .
so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .
um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control but uh we also have to stand out , i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options .
but it 's cool if it was green .
okay , this was uh my presentation .
it must be around it then .
which one first ?
--------------------
Ref:
firstly , user interface suggested the group should stand up with a unique design like different shapes than usual .
user interface also suggested a new option for favorite channels and a menu button that could integrate with volume , the previous and next buttons .
the group agreed to make the remote a bit smaller and would like to look at mobile phones when designing it .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the design of the look and feel and the user interface design .
firstly , industrial designer introduced the prototype drawing on the smartboard project manager 's previous presentation .
the group got acquainted with each other by drawing their favourite animals in the drawing board .
then , they discussed the energy source for the remote controls , including solar cells , single-curved case , double curve cases , latex cases and hand dynamos .
they decided to use a combination of wood , titanium and plastic as the source of energy .
after that , the team went on to discuss the voice function with the infrared issue because it was of concern to many people .
--------------------
topk:
on the energy , well , we decided .
but um sebastian has everything .
keep it in mind .
and um the buttons , well we talked about it now .
the next phase , um sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel .
the user interface design .
it would be very new , okay , what about um the issue i um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?
um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .
because it it 's of cour user interface um but they like dark colours , i think both .
and for you , the product evaluation .
um i 'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .
okay , single-curved case .
okay .
what about the energy source ?
like the watch .
um and uh the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard .
but it 's quite uh advanced and it 's it 's quite daring to to use i think .
um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing .
we can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it 's not slippery .
we can use wood and titanium .
well , um we can not use the titanium on the double curve cases .
and these latex cases , there 's there 's just the plastic ones uh wo n't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .
which brings me to the different energy sources .
um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls .
yeah , with colourful rubber .
um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product .
i guess that is something for roo and sebastian .
uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
okay , not at all .
with and uh { disfmarker } .
for the finishing touch .
the project drawing is for the next { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
this is the third meeting of the design group .
at first , marketing revealed that ease of use , innovation and a fancy look and feel could be important to customers and the team discussed what colour and material they should use .
then industrial designer introduced three casing possibilities : uncurved , single-curved and double-curved .
next , the team talked about whether to use kinetic energy supply as an energy source .
in terms of user interface controls , industrial designer proposed to add a scroll-wheel that could be integrated with buttons .
finally , the team summed up their decisions and project manager asked user interface designer to create a prototype next .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface proposed to add on ruud 's information , such as voice recognition and fancy colours and so on , and still have the ease of use , because all the other remote controls were high-tech in buttons and buttons .
project manager agreed .
industrial designer thought it was quite advanced and daring to use different types of finishing .
they can use plastic , which is slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , wood and titanium .
latex cases can be made of latex and rubber .
--------------------
topk:
on the energy , well , we decided .
like the watch .
user interface um with and uh { disfmarker } yes , they can work .
but they like dark colours , and for you , the product evaluation .
um i 'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that .
oh and um to add on um ruud 's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .
and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .
i believe uh miss uh tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
but it 's quite uh advanced and it 's it 's quite daring to to use i think .
um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing .
we can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it 's not slippery .
we can use wood and titanium .
well , um we can not use the titanium on the double curve cases .
and these latex cases , there 's there 's just the plastic ones uh wo n't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .
which brings me to the different energy sources .
um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls .
i think both .
but um sebastian has everything .
they can be complementary .
uh al al i uh { disfmarker } yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .
you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
every device { disfmarker } or the the back .
or the back .
and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .
yeah .
the third meeting .
{ vocalsound } yeah , yeah .
okay .
okay , well
--------------------
Ref:
the team decided to make a single-curved remote control with colourful rubber .
it would be powered by traditional batteries and solar .
they would also add a scroll-wheel with some additional buttons .
in addition , corporate identity should be embodied so the colours could be black and yellow .
as they decided not to use an lcd display , a regular chip would be selected .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager proposed to make the remote control very light but a grip .
industrial designer thought it would be better if it was not too glatt , too slippery , and the feel of the material had to be spongy .
user interface agreed and suggested that the front , on which the buttons are located , could be made of rubber .
marketing thought they should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , with exchangeable covers .
project manager added that there should be a little shape underneath where users could put their fingers in .
--------------------
topk:
no no no .
yes .
okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
yes .
there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , but it 's a kind of a retro uh style , i think .
but the front , on which the the buttons are does n't have to be rubber .
about mute .
slippery .
well , this this is an example of what they would like .
but since we 're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , i think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all .
like the watch .
um it should n't be too uh glatt , too slippery , yes .
that is possible too .
yes .
and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .
yeah .
keep it in mind .
and um the buttons , well we talked about it now .
the next phase , um sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel .
the user interface design .
so we could provide both for the young and the old what they like .
user interface um but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques .
they 're actually very slow in its techniques .
and what i 'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um i mean this is how you hold a remote control .
but they like dark colours , uh the fancy look and feel .
and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market .
so i 'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing revealed that the younger target group preferred colourful objects and soft material .
project manager agreed and added that the remote control should be light and not too slippery .
then industrial designer introduced three casing possibilities : uncurved , single-curved and double-curved .
considering that uncurved design could be too dull and double-curved design would make it difficult to use scroll-wheels , the team chose the single-curved design .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team decided to use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exchangeable covers .
the feel of the material has to be spongy .
industrial designer thought it would be better if the remote control could be made in a retro style .
marketing thought younger people liked soft material .
user interface thought dark colours were better .
project manager agreed .
on the energy source , the team thought solar power was better than traditional solar cells .
in terms of material , rubber was preferred because it was more durable .
--------------------
topk:
no no no .
yes .
okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
yeah , the younger people liked soft material .
okay , spongy materials .
uh the fancy look and feel .
like the watch .
well , findings .
uh ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .
and uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , but it 's a kind of a retro uh style , i think .
well , this this is an example of what they would like .
but since we 're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , i think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
well , uh one example given was this , so um i assume they just want something colourful .
not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
and we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .
the user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .
and these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .
so it 's just like a mouse .
you can scroll 'em , you can also push it .
um uh in the indicators we have the lcd displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently { disfmarker } user interface um use with .
and um colouring is important and and uh soft materials .
so i think this is the best of two worlds .
it looks likes a banana .
we have the fruit , we have the colours .
we have the simple design .
has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?
{ vocalsound } uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension .
i c i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation .
the the big remote control , something like that .
but they like dark colours , on the energy , well , we decided .
not at all .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer supposed that natural feeling could be a factor .
marketing agreed and revealed that the younger target group preferred soft material but not necessarily a real sponge .
then user interface proposed to use rubber , which was agreed by the whole team .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
when discussing the shape of the remote control , the team decided to use a single-curved design for the finishing touch .
industrial designer pointed out that there was no way to integrate lcd displays or scroll wheels because it was all curved .
user interface supplemented that infrared remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all , so the volume button on the side would be perfect for this design .
project manager agreed and proposed that the casing could be curved as well .
however , this idea was quickly rejected by the other team members .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .
you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
they can not work with double-curved .
so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
the casing is curved , single-curved .
okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons .
there 's no way you can integrate lcd displays .
there 's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it 's all curved .
use with .
yes , they can work .
user interface um uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension .
i c i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation .
the the big remote control , something like that .
not at all .
because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities .
um i had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design .
uh these are the things we 've looked at .
and of course i used the web to uh find my information .
about the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .
we have the uncurved or flat case .
uh that 's the most common uh remote con control form uh we 're used to is just a it ju it 's just a box .
i 'm sorry i i do n't have any pictures of uh of this thing .
we have uh a curved one .
it 's uh curved in two dimensions .
you have to imagine it 's a bit like a wave form .
so it 's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape .
like the watch .
i think both .
so { disfmarker } yes .
there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , .
for the finishing touch .
not something dull .
so { disfmarker } but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all .
you kn you know , ruud , as well ?
about th
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer introduced uncurved , single-curved and double-curved design at first .
user interface and project manager thought that uncurved design was too dull and industrial designer pointed out that double-curved design would make it impossible to use scroll-wheels , so the team selected single-curved design eventually .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface designer suggested that the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect for this function .
project manager agreed .
user interface also proposed that infrared remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all .
industrial designer thought that there are no flat areas where the components can incorporate these things .
there should be a little shape underneath where users can put their fingers in order to find the buttons .
the group agreed on this idea and decided to use plastic buttons in the rubber material .
--------------------
topk:
so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .
you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
user interface um about mute .
oh and um to add on um ruud 's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .
and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .
but they like dark colours , yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .
in the rubber .
use with .
'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
with and uh { disfmarker } there 's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things .
so that 's a limitation .
about um the components , uh just the hardware .
we basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal .
uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me .
but i think that 's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
keep it in mind .
and um the buttons , well we talked about it now .
the next phase , um sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel .
the user interface design .
not at all .
yes .
there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , you kn you know , ruud , as well ?
about th on the energy , well , we decided .
like the watch .
that 's okay .
but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all .
yes .
that is possible too .
yes .

Ref:
industrial designer proposed to use scroll-wheels , which could be integrated with buttons .
user interface doubted its practicability and then project manager proposed to integrate a scroll-bar on the side to mute the device .
as they would not use an lcd display , a regular chip was enough .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought scroll-wheels could be handy .
project manager thought it added a little extra high-tech feeling to the remote control .
user interface disagreed , pointing out that it was not flashy and new .
industrial designer said they could not work with double-curved cases because it would be impossible to integrate lcd displays .
push-buttons were preferred .
marketing thought volume button on the side was perfect because all the sony telephones use it for volume , and the team agreed .
--------------------
topk:
'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control .
you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb .
technology .
nokia has a well , okay , it 's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
too { disfmarker } no .
think so too .
well , all the sony telephones use it , for example , for volume .
user interface um okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , i think uh they they can be they can be handy .
okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons .
there 's no way you can integrate lcd displays .
there 's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it 's all curved .
so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
a scroll-wheel .
they can not work with double-curved .
and we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .
the user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels .
and these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .
so it 's just like a mouse .
you can scroll 'em , you can also push it .
um uh in the indicators we have the lcd displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently { disfmarker } not at all .
yes .
it 's not very flashy and new .
hmm .
yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
yes , they can work .
or the the back .
or the back .
because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer proposed to use scroll-wheels integrated with buttons .
user interface doubted its practicability and supposed that a round button with four directions could be better .
but project manager liked the idea of scroll-wheels as it might attract young customers and suggested that they could be used to mute the device .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team decided not to use lcd displays because there was no way to integrate scroll-wheels , because it 's all curved and there were no flat areas where they could incorporate these things .
also , project manager pointed out that voice recognition was an advanced function that required a fancy chip , which was a bit more costly .
the team agreed to keep the regular chip for the finishing touch .
on the other hand , the advanced chip could be integrated into the remote control , making it more user-friendly .

okay , so that 's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for .
okay .
this sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , i thought .
um no op i 'm not very sure .
no , it 's not in here .
if we want to use the lcd display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly .
if we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version .
and if we do n't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .

--------------------
Ref:
industrial manager revealed that if lcd was used , they had to choose advanced chips .
project manager thought it was within the budget and lcd displays could add extra high-tech feeling .
user interface then pointed out that they already had too many high-tech substances including scroll-wheels , voice recognition and a fancy look so they did n't need to use lcd displays .

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the working design of the remote control .
firstly , industrial designer introduced the basic idea of what they were going to do .
they would have a universal control , one handset for all , tv , video equipment , rechargeable batteries , a power source for the batteries and a decoding device to decode the information that they 're putting in from from the controller .
then , project manager asked the team to focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible .
after that , marketing gave a presentation on the findings of their previous research , which included the company 's logo and other things associated with the product .
next , user interface presented the new project requirements , including teletext and speech recognition as well as the location function .
finally , the group discussed the size issue and decided to look at something a bit smaller .
--------------------
topk:
they are .
what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?
mm , and the rechargeable batteries .
they do .
um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , tv , video equipment .
f_ function .
i mean look at the mobile .
we have new project requirements , um we 're not going to be using teletext , video plus .
so in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .
mm .
but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible yep there we go .
okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
can you look into the company logo ?
um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
alright okay , and yeah , that 's that 's what i came up with there , um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .
um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine .
and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer .
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do .
that could be the most common design .
just whack in the number .
you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do n't need to send very much information .
um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
now our one , i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .
so again there 's power implications there .
um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .
um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .
you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can
--------------------
Ref:
the team mainly made some adjustments to the remote control design to meet the new project requirements .
the second meeting started with project manager who briefly went over the last meeting .
industrial designer hoped to minimize the size of the battery .
the team thus decided on a rechargeable one .
user interface desired to simplify the remote control style , cutting down unnecessary functions .
according to the market research presented by marketing , the team agreed on a trendy and user-friendly flip-top design .
an alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager suggested a flip top design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that .
industrial designer agreed and suggested that they could look into the company logo and other things associated with the product in view to incorporate that into their design .
project manager also suggested rechargeable batteries with a docking station , which could be used to charge the device once it was charged .
the group discussed the battery issue and decided that it did n't really matter because it never really ran out once they charged it .
--------------------
topk:
mm , and the rechargeable batteries .
um , what other functions ?
we need i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you 've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about .
mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
but just to have that function would be would be really good .
it is with that i think we 'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
um , that 's so this is if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .
okay so we 've got a flip-screen .
alright okay , and yeah , that 's that 's what i came up with there , um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do n't need to send very much information .
um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
now our one , i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
rechargeable with a docking station .
but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .
so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible .
and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .
so what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer .
we discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .
okay .
um , three presentations , i 've got written here so shall we hear from marketing first ?
so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .
so again there 's power implications there .
um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .
um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .
you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment .
and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good .
um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
but it does n't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged .
trendy kind of a thing .
then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think .
i think it 's a really nice idea um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .
um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine .
and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer .
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do .
'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so .
what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ?
well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to .
um , so i decided i 'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .
but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wan na make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was n't really my area because i 'm dealing with the inside really .
so um , yeah i ran out of time so i could n't do this one as fun as the last one .
can you look into the company logo ?
um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product .
--------------------
Ref:
on battery issue , industrial designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery .
meanwhile , cost , power consumption , wireless range and data transmission were supposed to be considered .
user interface 's presentation followed .
the remote control design would be simplified and user-friendly .
to make the style more trendy , user interface decided on a flip-top model .

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that triple a batteries were too big and bulky for the remote control .
most remote controls used infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of sending too much information .
and most of them were powered by some form of battery .
so industrial designer did n't know whether they wanted to look at something else so they could shrink down the size .
marketing thought it was most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power was coming from for a product like this .

current .
ah .
look at that .
yeah on that as well so .
yeah the the { disfmarker } rechargeable with a docking station .
were too big .
that could be the most common design .
um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they 're quite they 're quite chunky and that 's because of the size of the batteries , can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i do n't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , i think so .
and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it 's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
yep there we go .
okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
but { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer admitted that current remote controls were mostly powered by triple a batteries .
however , industrial designer also pointed out that they were bulky , although they had been the smallest fit-in batteries at present .
industrial designer expressed a desire to find a smaller alternative for triple a batteries .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
market research revealed that seventy five percent of users found most remote controls ugly , eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , and seventy-five percent zapped a lot of the time .
therefore , the team decided to adjust the design according to the market research findings and focus on the biggest market segments , such as fifteen to sixty year olds and people paying more for it to look good .
marketing also suggested that the corporate image should be incorporated into the handset .
industrial designer agreed on that as well .
--------------------
topk:
we could focus on the biggest market .
what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , i mean what you were talking about with the marketing .
um , people paying more for it to look good .
um , we need to focus on that as well .
that could be the most common design .
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus .
okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .
um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .
our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here .
the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .
um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking .
um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , we have new project requirements , um we 're not going to be using teletext , you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
mm , and the rechargeable batteries .
so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .
so again there 's power implications there .
um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .
um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .
you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can yeah on that as well so .
yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .
so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible .
and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .
so what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do n't need to send very much information .
um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
now our one , i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment .
and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good .
um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , they do .
they are .
can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i do n't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .
um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine .
and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer .
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do .
that 's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
--------------------
Ref:
the market research presented by marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated .
project manager added that an ideal model would be for tv only and have a corporate logo incorporated .
to meet the requirements above , industrial designer recommended a touch screen panel .
marketing suggested that the remote control size could be adjusted due to physical differences among international users .
the team gave up speech recognition , for it would cost a lot .
an alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer pointed out that most controls used infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of sending too much information .
most of them were powered by some form of battery , and those can be quite bulky .
therefore , industrial designer thought it would be better if they could shrink down the remote control so that it could be small and easy to carry around .
project manager agreed and suggested incorporating an alarm or a beeping for being lost .
user interface suggested speech recognition , which was rejected by marketing because it was incompatible with the corporate image .
--------------------
topk:
and we 've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .
were too big .
yep there we go .
okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
is that okay ?
um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .

yeah , speech recognition , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .
so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible .
and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .
so what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design 'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so .
what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ?
well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to .
um , so i decided i 'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .
but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wan na make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was n't really my area because i 'm dealing with the inside really .
so um , yeah i ran out of time so i could n't do this one as fun as the last one .
um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do n't need to send very much information .
um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
now our one , i 'm i 'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did n't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .
okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .
um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .
our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here .
the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .
um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking .
um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , for detection , right .
you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
or a speech recognition , um , something like that should reduce the size of it .
mm .
i think we assume that it 's still got play and stop functions and programming .
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus .
i mean look at the mobile .
that could be the most common design .
--------------------
Ref:
the market research implicated that users ' biggest frustration was their failure in finding the remote control once it was lost in the house .
to solve the problem , industrial designer suggested that a button could be added on the tv ; when the user pressed the button , the remote control would beep to let the user know its location .
meanwhile , such a solution would be within budget .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer pointed out that most controls used infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of sending too much information .
most of them were powered by some form of battery , and those can be quite bulky .
therefore , it would be better to look at something else so that the control could shrink down the size .
industrial designer also suggested that there could be physically different designs for different age groups based on market research and adjustments due to new project requirements .
user interface agreed and proposed a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say the young generation or trendy generation want to program their favourite channels or whatever .
--------------------
topk:
mm .
but also er ergonomics as we 're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there 's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you 've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would n't buy it because the controller was physically to big were too big .
the features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
yep there we go .
okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
they do .
that could be the most common design .
oh , there .
you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
so , a bigger b okay so y you 're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you 're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market .
'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so .
what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ?
well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to .

so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think .
i think it 's a really nice idea is that okay ?
um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the tv presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you do n't need to send very much information .
um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .

th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .
okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .
um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .

um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , yeah .
yeah , speech recognition ,
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer was inspired by the design of xbox and gave an example of japanese people 's small hands compared to the big controller .
out of ergonomic considerations , industrial designer encouraged the team to notice the physical differences among users all over the world when deciding the remote control size .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
market research showed that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly , eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , and seventy-five percent zap a lot of the time .
therefore , the team decided to incorporate the corporate image into the design .
project manager also proposed to focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible so that the product would be accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone to the young generation .
--------------------
topk:
so in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .
mm .
but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface .
we definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we do n't want that .
so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping .
so again there 's power implications there .
um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there .
um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control .
um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .
you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems .
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .

but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together .
so what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design i always found that really easy when i discovered it , um um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , i mean what you were talking about with the marketing .
um , people paying more for it to look good .
um , we need to focus on that as well .
um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , that could be the most common design .
um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .
we decided it was important to reflect the company 's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .
um , our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay .
um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .
um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round .
um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine .
and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer .
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do .
trendy kind of a thing .
with that i think we 'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
um , that 's so this is if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .
you get the idea .
it 's it 's gon na vary around the world .
at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it 's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment .
and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good .
um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think .
i think it 's a really nice idea okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research .
um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .
our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here .
the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there .
um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking .
um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , 'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so .
what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ?
well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to .
um , so i decided i 'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that .
but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wan na make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was n't really my area because i 'm dealing with the inside really .
so um , yeah i ran out of time so i could n't do this one as fun as the last one .
we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did n't differentiate .
would you prefer an lcd screen , that 's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?
we are we 're talking about um the type of company that we 're working for as well .
that they want um it to be fashionable ,
--------------------
Ref:
overall , the model style was expected to be trendy and appealing .
marketing and project manager agreed on user interface 's design of a flip-screen .
marketing also hoped that the remote control would be slightly curved .
user interface added that the remote control would curl up to users ' hands so that their thumbs did not have to press .
the corporate logo would be put in the corner .
the model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control project .
firstly , project manager reviewed what they did in the last meeting , including how they targeted their audience and how helpful that was .
then , marketing gave a presentation on the current trends in electronics and fashion , and the team got acquainted with each other .
next , industrial designer and user interface gave their presentations on components concept and energy .
after that , the group discussed the look and feel of their product and did a product evaluation .
they agreed that the fruit and vegetable theme would be good for the product , while the material should be limited to spongy .
--------------------
topk:
and , components concept .
question mark .
energy .
question mark .
um , i 'll just review what we did in our last meeting .
um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and um , yeah .
that was generally how helpful that was .
mm .
and it is technologically innovative in a way , ha .
mm .
right , um , i have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel .
um .
next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .
and th last thing is the easy to use um factor .
um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use .
um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend at least on theirs .
alright we 're moving on to conceptual design .
well they usually are .
yeah , the fashion in electronics .
so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .
and also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer .
as to the material should be limited to i do n't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , i do n't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that 's the way to go .
um .
i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables , my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the tv .
would anybody like to go first ?
the dynamo would be interesting .
fruits and veg .
um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design .
and you 're gon na be doing protu product evaluation .
so you 'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .
yeah , yeah .
that was me .
um , and finally again with the spongy .
it has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that 's better than mine .
um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter .
but the screen can come up on the telly , the she said .
which frankly i 'm not particularly fond of ,
--------------------
Ref:
this meeting was mainly about conceptual design .
industrial designer , marketing and user interface gave presentations mainly on component design , current trend and interface design respectively , based on their research on the website incorporating the ideas from last meeting .
a lot of discussions was centred around the fruit and vegetable theme , which was the current marketing trend .
in the meanwhile , they had some discussions on physical attributes and the use of energy .
they agreed that the screen was not necessary , and tv could be used as the screen instead .
in addition , kryptonite became their preferred energy .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group discussed the current trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics .
marketing suggested that they should go fruit and vegetables , and also go for a spongy feel .
industrial designer suggested a sort of rubber that 's in those stress ball things .
user interface suggested wood , while project manager preferred plastic because it was trendy and the ipods were really hot right now .
in the end , the group decided to go with dynamo for the time being and used rubber as the base material .
--------------------
topk:
i actually was n't aware of the new trends in electronics neither was i. well it 's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics .
{ vocalsound } yeah .
i guess .
and it is trendy , the ipods are really hot right now , so { disfmarker } one of the material options is a sort of rubber that 's in like those stress ball things .
so , that would be spongy .
the fashion in electronics .
so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .
and also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer .
as to the material should be limited to i do n't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , i do n't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that 's the way to go .
um .
i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables , i 'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking .
if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you 're actually holding in your hand , so like what you 're feeling is comfortable , and then there 's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is .
but but imagine someone with s at least on theirs .
on the { disfmarker } um , and finally again with the spongy .
it has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that 's better than mine .
um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter .
ha .

next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .

um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use .
um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend yeah .
i mean i think uh and i think the handhe i think the handheld part is definitely so you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .
to { disfmarker } hmm ?
uh , well we can use wood .
i do n't know why we 'd want to .
um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
we ca n't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
i do n't think it 's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
so that 's what i 've got on design .
yeah you could squish it .
the dynamo would be interesting .
and , so so okay , let me get this right .
okay , uh okay , alright anyway .
um here we go .
conceptual user interface .
trying we 're gon na try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
which frankly i 'm not particularly fond of , was that you ?
--------------------
Ref:
marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product .
the fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend , and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables .
therefore , how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials .
the potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber , which was used in the stress balls .
the alternative option was to use a cover for it , and choose a colour that fits one 's sitting room .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that the material should be limited to rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
he recommended against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy .
and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons on the remote control , we should n't use rubber ones .
the industrial designer also mentioned that for things like remote controls , they stamp out a chip to make it easier to find , and a dynamo would be interesting .
--------------------
topk:
and , um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , so i 've been looking at the components design .
um .
mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we 'll just use standard .
um , i assume we 'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
and we 'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .
but once we come up with a design we 'll send it to the circuit people and they 'll just print it out .
um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel .
the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gon na be included in the circuit board that comes with it .
um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .
and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
so we have some material options .
um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
um , i 'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy .
um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we should n um , and finally again with the spongy .
it has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that 's better than mine .
um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter .
the fashion in electronics .

um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend that was me .
w when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top i think , if you held it like that .
mm .
and it is technologically innovative in a way , my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the tv .
but , were there buttons on there as well ?
yeah you could squish it .
oh okay .
yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you 'd basically have to wind it yourself .
the dynamo would be interesting .
what if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you do n't use very much ?
like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ?
so the options are there but they 're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .
at least on theirs .
oh , i was gon na say .
that was one of th i i was { disfmarker } um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design .
and you 're gon na be doing protu product evaluation .
so you 'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .
oh , okay , that would be cool .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer thought some parts needed custom design , and other parts should just use standard .
for example , the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator , and the circuit board needed custom design as well , while the buttons and the wheels , radio sender and receiver were all standard parts .
in addition , beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote .
rubber , plastic , wood and titanium were options of materials , but better not titanium .
regular chips were required if the ipod-style wheel button was used .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
when discussing the necessity of screen usage , project manager first pointed out that the remote control itself was n't cluttered up , so it would not be necessary to have a screen for it to work .
user interface then suggested that if users can get to the menu on the tv screen , then they would need to scroll to get channels .
industrial designer then proposed that they need a dynamo screen with music because users were looking for a specific song , like they know that band or whatever .
with tv channels it 's , you know , one two three .
--------------------
topk:
you it seems like you would need a screen .
yeah , but , i mean , do you need that ?
if if you can get to , you know if so long as you 're able to bring up the menu on the tv screen .
you need a screen for it ?
you know .
but you 're gon na have to scroll to get channels .
so um i guess that 's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just i guess i c i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the tv like what channel you 're on .
ha .

--------------------
Ref:
user interface assumed they were going to have a screen at first , since user interface thought a screen was necessary for people to visualize things such as a specific song when looking for one .
however , since adding a screen cost more money , and tv could be used as the screen , they finally decided that screen was not necessary .

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer suggested that they could use batteries , solar power , and a dynamo , which was a kinetic thing where you 'd basically have to wind it yourself .
however , this idea was quickly rejected by marketing and project manager because he thought it would be too expensive .
the group then discussed other options of energy , such as a combination of solar and conventional batteries .
they finally decided to use a spongy material like fruit and vegetables as the energy source because it was technologically innovative in a way .

--------------------
Ref:
battery , solar power , dynamo , kryptonite were potential options of the energy .
they ended up with a preference on kryptonite .
even though they could not find an exact price for it , it would not be more expensive than a chip .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that there were several options for energy , including batteries , solar power , and a dynamo , which frankly he was not particularly fond of because he thought it was technologically innovative in a way that it did not create energy on its own .
the other option was a kinetic thing where you 'd basically have to wind it yourself .
however , this was more expensive than a regular chip , so he decided to get an advanced chip if they wanted to have a screen in , at least for the time being .

um .
next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .
and th last thing is the easy to use um factor .
um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use .
um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend a relaxing squashy ball .

but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer preferred battery .
industrial designer was not very familiar with dynamo .
wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power were all possible , but solar power would not be available with the rubber case .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
when discussing the cost of the kryptonite , industrial designer first pointed out that it was more expensive than batteries , solar power , and a dynamo .
however , project manager quickly rebutted this point , arguing that the chip was probably the most expensive part because it had to be an advanced chip if they wanted to have a screen in , which meant it would cost more than the regular chip .
marketing then brought up fruit and vegetable theme as the current trend in electronics , so the team agreed to go for a spongy feel .
--------------------
topk:
most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk .
so i do n't think it 's that much of a problem .
like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
which is cheaper .
and , the dynamo would be interesting .
uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , yeah you could squish it .
no .
but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own .

what about kryptonite ?
{ vocalsound } you have to get a an advanced chip if you wan na have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .
which is quite cool .
so if you throw it , it 's gon na store loads of energy , and you do n't need to buy a battery 'cause they 're quite f i find them annoying .
but we need to find cost .
hmm ?
uh , well we can use wood .
i do n't know why we 'd want to .
um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
we ca n't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
i do n't think it 's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
so that 's what i 've got on design .
that was one of th i i was { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } so so okay , let me get this right .
okay , uh okay , alright anyway .
um here we go .
conceptual user interface .
trying we 're gon na try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .
you can just take theirs and just { vocalsound } well you can have it on the settings , the fashion in electronics .
so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .
and also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer .
as to the material should be limited to i do n't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , i do n't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that 's the way to go .
um .
i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables , and why not wood ?
--------------------
Ref:
the website did not give an actual cost , but most of the stuff was cheap .
the chip would be the most expensive part anyway , so the group should not worry about the cost of the kryptonite too much .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the prototype of the remote control project .
firstly , the team got acquainted with each other by drawing their favourite animals on the whiteboard .
then , marketing , user interface and project manager each gave a presentation about their ideas for the project and the evaluation criteria .
after that , they discussed the budget , which was set at 12.5 million euros .
they also decided to use a different chip for speech recognition and scrollwheel , backlights , slide and lcd screen , and a universal device .
--------------------
topk:
that was it .
no , for the prototype .
new ideas .
they went for uh for a universal device .
what 's the average ?
uh then the re our beautiful drawing .
i think just on the buttons .
and the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
but then we also have the the home station .
yeah , in thi the the remote control in the in the bottom .
uh all the the seven , uh all the seven .
evaluation crit yeah , evaluation presentation .
it 's not in .
uh d it does n't matter um it only had two pages or something .
um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market .
the italians uh , how they think about it .
and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff .
i made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our but the teamwork was okay .
okay , and the the the lightning ?
stupid , the lcd screen .
together ?
no , you have a different chip for speech recognition .
so { disfmarker } well , leader ?
project manager ?
okay , next one .
--------------------
Ref:
this meeting was about the prototype presentation of the remote control .
firstly , the group had a prototype discussion on the remote control 's scroll wheel , standard place , the round shape , the multiple speech buttons , the menu buttons , and the text button with hard plastic material .
next , the group evaluated remote 's look , ease of use , and technological innovation based on different criteria .
lastly , the group discussed that the production price would be 12.3 euros , and the target price would be 20 euros .
finally , they posed a quick challenge on using the magic pen and the board to draw design features .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team agreed that the evaluation criteria should be based on the marketing strategy , the research about the new needs and the market , as well as the speech function and colour theme of the product .
they also made some criteria from one to zero , and then they could give themselves an average for their score .
the team decided to give a maximum score of 3.5 out of 5 , which was good enough for the project manager to recommend it to the other team members .
after that , they discussed how to implement the criteria in the final design .
--------------------
topk:
they went for uh for a universal device .
evaluation crit yeah , evaluation presentation .
it 's not in .
uh d it does n't matter um it only had two pages or something .
um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market .
the italians uh , how they think about it .
and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff .
i made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our in the bottom .
that was it .
that as well , yeah .
for the bottom .
no .
no , it 's only on the number , behind the numbers but then we also have the the home station .
uh then the re like on the normal uh like this .
the speech function and the colour .
colour .
of course there was .
yeah , but this one .
what 's the average ?
no , for the project .
{ vocalsound } yeah , as well .
special form , yeah .
{ vocalsound } yeah , from the previous group .
{ vocalsound } of course it 's reachable .
i found it as well .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing set the criteria for evaluation .
the group gave two points on the fancy look and feel , three points on the ease of use and learnable , and two points on technological innovation because the group thought new features were not all extraordinary .
besides , they gave two points on the target market trend which said that the products with fruit and vegetables in different colors might be popular .
lastly , they gave high marks on the room for creativity and leadership .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that easy to use and learnable were the two most important criteria to meet .
user interface pointed out that the first parts , like speech , would be easier to learn if the remote control was universal and user-friendly , while the second part , such as the lcd screen , could be harder to navigate if it was not universal .
project manager agreed and proposed to give it a two-point scale from one to zero .
the team agreed on one point and gave an average of two points to each criterion .
--------------------
topk:
because easy to use comes after learnable .
but then we also have the the home station .
yeah , as well .
they went for uh for a universal device .
stupid , the lcd screen .
so just give it a two .
uh then the re evaluation crit yeah , evaluation presentation .
it 's not in .
uh d it does n't matter um it only had two pages or something .
um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market .
the italians uh , how they think about it .
and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff .
i made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our yeah , to navigate .
that was it .
yeah , the three stages .
yes .
of course there was .
but the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
for the bottom .
yeah , in thi the the remote control in the no , for the project .
{ vocalsound } eleven divided by six .
like on the normal uh like this .
that as well , yeah .
the touchscreen , yeah .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager thought the second layer of the remote was not easy to learn but industrial designer responded that users would not need to pay attention to that part .
the group reached a consensus that the scroll wheel was much better than average .
so they gave a two on this criterion .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing recommended to test the criteria from one to zero , and then give themselves an average for their evaluation .
for example , they could check whether they followed the latest trends .
if they did n't , then they should adjust the product accordingly .
in terms of appearance , marketing believed that their product should be black and yellow , with a front that 's like a banana , or something flashy like an ipod , for it would stand out in the market and attract more customers .
as for the material , it could be made of plastic or rubber .
--------------------
topk:
evaluation crit yeah , evaluation presentation .
it 's not in .
uh d it does n't matter um it only had two pages or something .
um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market .
the italians uh , how they think about it .
and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff .
i made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our yeah , in thi the the remote control in the uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea .
it quite beautiful .
a front that 's that 's like uh like a banana , or something .
flashy .
so we targeted it ?
but we did n't follow the latest trends .
like a a f banana kind of front .
that as well , yeah .
so that was it .
that was it .
for the bottom .
yeah , yellow light .
tha these are the only latest uh trends i uh get on my computer .
of course there was .
yeah .
i did save it .
yeah , as well .
for remote control probably .
so you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
yeah , the three stages .
yes .
black and yellow .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager thought they should skip the speaker when user interface mentioned the power indicator .
marketing recommended that they need a button to beep for calling and they should include the speaker because it was usable and small enough .
also , marketing supplemented that the production cost has been considered and within 12.3 euros .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group decided to use the drawing board as the basis for the design of the remote control because it was cheaper and more user-friendly , and the speaker was very small as well .
they also agreed that the home station would be located in the living room so that it could be easily accessed from the dining room .
in terms of finance , they would use a combination of cash and credit cards , with the budget set at 12.5 euros .
the team would have to make a profit in order to finance the project .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , as well .
that was it .
but then we also have the the home station .
they went for uh for a universal device .
but the teamwork was okay .
come on .
yeah , in thi the the remote control in the yeah , finance .
that as well , yeah .
no , for the project .
{ vocalsound } so that was it .
this ?
okay , and the the the lightning ?
the chip .
for remote control probably .
it was { disfmarker } yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?
for the bottom .
uh then the re to call .
--------------------
Ref:
the remote price would be at twenty euros .
and the production cost would be twelve point three euros .
and the group thought that the use of both the board and the pen to draw on the remote prototype was stupid and not handy enough .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface pointed out that they got wrong information at the wrong time about the budget , and there was a big hole here as well as there were other problems with the remote control , such as not having enough buttons and not being able to create all round shapes .
also , the main zap buttons were most central and that was the most important thing for the team to solve .
project manager agreed with user interface on this point and proposed to add a menu button in the middle of the three stages .
--------------------
topk:
it was { disfmarker } yeah , in thi the the remote control in the so that was it .
yeah , we have that on the the text button .
well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
that was the the most important thing .
yeah , the three stages .
yes .
i think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
that was it .
no i w okay , i 'm not that whiny .
but uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well .
that as well , yeah .
so uh the best place , the best reach place um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out .
that way you do n't have to make it red , 'cause it 's will uh will show up .
uh scrollwheel is on the left side .
it 's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as i know .
uh i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time .
i think that was the m biggest problem .
so that 's both .
but um i 'll just uh i 'll get back to later .
f the form well , we 've taken that from the ipod , other popular technical device .
so um should be popular .
um the f uh the buttons creating ?
uh if you that or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
it some text uh buttons .
uh i only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
i found it as well .
yeah , as well .
yeah , with in the middle um a menu button .
yeah , finance .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface mentioned that they got the wrong information at the wrong time , and it was the biggest problem .
otherwise , the group could finish the finance discussion earlier , and they should have had discussions quicker .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the functional design of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced the agenda for the next meeting , which was to get to know each other a bit better and discuss the project plan .
then , industrial designer , user interface and marketing each gave a presentation on their respective experiences with remote controls .
after that , the group went on to practice with the pens and draw their favourite animals on the white board , and sum up the characteristics of that animal .
finally , they discussed the age gap between themselves and their target customers .
--------------------
topk:
they 're good at golf .
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
it would probably .
i mean there 's sky remote controls and everything .
they 're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , hopefully that 'll stay on , two-handed version .
so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , okay , right .
we 're gon na practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i 'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .
teletext has got that option as well .
use all the ones at the same time .
so then { disfmarker } so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog .
an eagle .
i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that 's where you control recording and things like that .
mm , yeah , the age gap .
well it was it was an at first { disfmarker } that c it 's about { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
project manager introduced a new remote control project .
the team started to know each other by drawing favourite animals .
project manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 euros , considering the 12.5-euro production cost .
the market range would be international and over all age groups .
after the financial targets , the team discussed the remote design .
despite the `` one-for-all `` style , the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly .
standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority .
the team , therefore , agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu .
silver lightweight plastic was temporarily decided to be the material , for it is easily moulded and cost-saving .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that the remote control should be user-friendly to everyone , not too big and too small , and it should have a lcd di display or something like that , like a mobile phone , to avoid too many buttons and make it complicated for the user .
they also agreed to change what was originally planned to be the main functions on the front of the control to other functions inside it , such as recording and teletext , so that it would be easier for users to find what they need .
--------------------
topk:
i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , user-friendly to everyone .
okay .
right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an lcd di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
teletext has got that option as well .
it would probably .
i mean there 's sky remote controls and everything .
they 're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , okay , now i 'm gon na have to change what is was originally gon na be so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , and there 's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
yeah , about what you 're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ?
the sort of i i had a quick look at the company website and it 's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so i think think the whole design thing might be qui an eagle .
there you go .
right .
right .
so that 's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , i would { disfmarker } and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that 's where you control recording and things like that .
use all the ones at the same time .
um .
when they 're when you 've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
so simplification of symbols you could think of .
technical help .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one .
marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons , which was not user-friendly enough .
instead , marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated .
project manager and user interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain .
user interface and industrial designer refused the flip top , however , for it costs a lot .
the team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing suggested that the menu display could be incorporated into the design of a remote control , but project manager pointed out that it was not a case of worrying about different languages and things like that .
instead , the group decided to have an lcd display or something like a mobile phone menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that 's where they could control recording and playback .
teletext could also be added as an option .
user interface agreed and proposed that a menu could make it easier to browse and navigate .
--------------------
topk:
and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that 's where you control recording and things like that .
actually that just raises a point , i wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it 's got a menu display , with menus , yeah , yeah .
right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an lcd di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so { disfmarker } and if it 's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
mm-hmm .
menu , alright .
yeah , um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
well it was it was an at first { disfmarker } yes , yes , i do n't think we have to i do n't think it 's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i would { disfmarker } teletext has got that option as well .
i presume it would .
yeah .
or what about kind of a dual function ?
in that you 've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things yeah , but it might have its cost implications .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing believed that most of the market would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features instead of any tampering or programming with too many buttons .
user interface agreed with the simplification of symbols .
the team came up with a menu display to make the remote more user-friendly .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that the older generation were quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
and birds of prey were n't they , so it would be useful to incorporate that into the design of a remote control .
in addition , industrial designer believed that it should be self-intuitive and easy to work out what everything 's doing , because menus on new phones now had all these pictures and made it fairly obvious what they were trying to do .
teletext has got that option as well .
--------------------
topk:
i do n't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system .
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
mm , yeah , the age gap .
right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an lcd di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , there you go .
i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it 's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything 's doing , 'cause i mean , menus on sort of new phones now they 've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you 're trying to do .
so { disfmarker } and i see them as majestic , and independent , and proud .
yeah , obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that 's the main thing .
teletext has got that option as well .
it might a seagu i would { disfmarker } i 'd say they 're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
and uh , birds of prey are n't they , okay , i see it as one thing it 's very supportive .
it 's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it does n't discriminate between you , based on what you are .
second it 's loyal and third thing it 's got intuition .
dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person are they ?
which is uh { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer initially worried about the replacement of buttons .
industrial designer was soon convinced by marketing that the age gap was a problem regardless of any design modifications and insisted on the incorporation of a menu display , however .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that the remote control did not need to be fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it could still be lightweight plastic .
however , he did n't know if using plastic did make it cheaper or more durable .
he also wondered if incorporating that into the design might be useful , but project manager pointed out that it would depend on the budget .
in the end , industrial designer decided to leave it to marketing to decide what to do with it and to find out more about it later .
--------------------
topk:
and there 's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
we do n't have to use metal , i do n't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , it would probably .
i mean there 's sky remote controls and everything .
they 're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , something that 's easily moulded and produced .
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .

okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
but yeah , i mean it does n't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i presume it would .
teletext has got that option as well .
i would { disfmarker } mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , um .
when they 're when you 've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
so yeah i guess that 's stuff we can think about .
technical help .
well it was it was an at first { disfmarker } about what you 're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ?
the sort of i i had a quick look at the company website and it 's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so i think think the whole design thing might be qui i mean you do n't you you can still have plastic but it might have its cost implications .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer was uncertain about whether the remote could look fashionable with plastic at first .
marketing and project manager exemplified other remote controls to make industrial designer believe that silver plastic could look smart .

project manager announced that the selling price of the remote control would be twenty-five euros in euros , which he did n't know what that is in pounds , at all .
the production cost was twelve fifty , and the profit aim was fifty million euros .
in order to achieve this goal , the team would have to find a big target group in the international market like australia , america , things like that .
teletext was also proposed as an option , but it might have its cost implications .
--------------------
topk:
mm , yeah , the age gap .
i would { disfmarker } um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , yeah , um production cost 's at twelve fifty , so so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , okay .
that was fun , right .
um finance-wise , we 've got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i do n't actually know what that is in pounds , at all .
any ideas ?
big target group .
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we 're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
teletext has got that option as well .
user-friendly to everyone .
okay .
well it was it was an at first { disfmarker } just that it 's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that .
it 's about { disfmarker } but it might have its cost implications .
my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , which is uh { disfmarker } mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
there you go .
yes , no that 's important .
but that kept losing the signals so we 'd have to re-programme it every now and again .
i think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it ,
--------------------
Ref:
project manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 euros , considering the 12.5-euro production cost .
the profit aim for the team would be 50 million euros in the first year .
the market range would be international and over all age groups .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought that the market range of the remote control should be international , accessible and usable by all age groups .
the profit aim is fifty million euros , and the selling price is taken up by building it .
production cost is twelve fifty , which is reasonable for a high-end product .
what 's more , project manager believed that it would be in the international market like australia , america , things like that , so it might be useful to incorporate that into the design .
--------------------
topk:
just that it 's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that .
you 've got market range international and you did say earlier it 's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups user-friendly to everyone .
okay .
um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is uh { disfmarker } big target group .
mm , yeah , the age gap .
um i 'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we 'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .

um , we want it to be original , something that 's uh people have n't thought of , that 's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it 's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design , what we 're thinking , how it 's gon na go and then the detailed design , how we 're actually gon na put it into practice and make it work .
my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme tv and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , half of the selling price is taken up by building it .
are they ?
and i see them as majestic , and independent , and proud .
so { disfmarker } i would { disfmarker } they 're good at golf .
i presume it would .
yeah , um production cost 's at twelve fifty , so so that { disfmarker } i 'm not good at golf .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager hoped to make the market range international , covering all age groups , instead of focusing solely on the business market .
project manager highlighted that the team should not worry about the language differences and the big target group would be achievable .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the look and feel design of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced the three concepts for the controller , including solar energy , batteries , and wood .
then , industrial designer and user interface gave a presentation on working design and discussed the material , color , shape , buttons , etc .
after that , marketing gave an update on the market analysis and the trend in fashion .
finally , the group discussed conceptual design .
they decided to mix the two concepts together , making the control easy to use , powerful and fancy .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
so let 's start our second me meeting on conceptual design .
interface concept .
no .
and we will have three presentations and we 'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we 'll close the decision .
so i will first uh { disfmarker } uh and what about the user interface concept ?
okay .
no .
there this is the three concepts of our controller .
and fruit and vegetables yeah .
yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .
if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion .
yeah , working design , let 's go to the industrial designer .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
then present it later .
as the previous meeting i will be the secretary some some efficient .
okay .
so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we 'll you will all have to work in in your direction .
so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .
but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
i think he need a control that is very reliable ,
--------------------
Ref:
this meeting was about conceptual design .
the user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - google controller , fancy controller , and intelligent controller .
the first two were approved by the project manager , but the last one was seriously questioned .
the group finally decided to mix the google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands .
the discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material , alimentation , and chip .
the industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with lcd , applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation , and using low level chips , which was agreed by the group .
the marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis .
users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative .
at the same time , being user-friendly was also important .
then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface designer first presented the concept of user interface .
there were three concepts in the interface design .
the first one was a google controller , the second is a fancy controller and the last one is an intelligent controller with easy to use and sophisticated functions such as vocal commands recognition and gesture recognition .
project manager then proposed to design a look and feel design for the remote control , based on the fruits and vegetables trends in fashion .
marketing then presented a short anal analysis of the market and gave a better overview of what 's the fashion in general .
then the group discussed some details about the buttons .
--------------------
topk:
interface concept .
no .
and what about the buttons ?
case .
because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .
adding some vocal commands .
yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .
if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
this .
okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion .
some some efficient .
mm .
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface .
um there 's three concepts in the user interface .
so first one it 's a google controller .
the second is a fancy controller .
the last one is uh intelligent controller .
so there are three concepts in our controller .
um n next i will explain one by one , the first is google controller .
um , so i want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .
so it 's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .
uh this is a first concept of our controller .
the second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um 'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
no one would would be interested .
yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
and lcd buttons .
and we will have three presentations and we 'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we 'll close the decision .
so i will first uh { disfmarker } just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
you think it 's possible ?
not too expensive too .
and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
okay .
so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we 'll you will all have to work in in your direction .
so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface designer introduced three concepts in the user interface - google controller , fancy controller , and intelligent controller .
the three meant that the product would be simple but powerful , attractive and recognizable , and loaded with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology .
the first two were approved by the project manager , but the last one was seriously questioned .
after a lot of discussions , the group finally decided to mix the google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the user interface designer proposed the concept of intelligent controller because it was a kind of other design , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
it can also be interesting to have cooperation with some research institutes on speech recognition and gesture recognition .
with this advanced features , the remote control can attract a lot of user .
however , at the same time , it would be better to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller .
maybe try to mix them together , just in one and do solar energy and batteries and with low level chips and wood .
--------------------
topk:
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
you think it 's possible ?
i think he need a control that is very reliable , interface ?
case .
no one would would be interested .
so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition .
um with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user .
mm .
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface .
um there 's three concepts in the user interface .
so first one it 's a google controller .
the second is a fancy controller .
the last one is uh intelligent controller .
so there are three concepts in our controller .

even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
a microphone maybe .
yeah , for the interface something added value .
but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
let 's go to the industrial designer .
but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .
do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
where is the controller ?
maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
so i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller .
maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ?
hmm ?
so wood .
and fruit and vegetables yeah .
but and it is a kind of other design , i mean .
it can also be interesting to have this kind of { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface designer believed a controller with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology would be convenient when you could n't find it .
more importantly , although the feature was not one hundred percent reliable , it was a feature to distinguish the new product from traditional ones .
and there 's not enough motivation for users to replace their old controller with a new one if there 's no key feature in the new controller .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager disapproved of the concept of intelligent controller because he thought it would be better to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller .
he believed that most people want to use the remote control to zap between channels , and they need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
besides , there were no breakthrough features of their controller compared to other products in the market , so it was not necessary to design a new controller without any breakthroughs in order to meet the user requirements .
--------------------
topk:
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
you think it 's possible ?
i think he need a control that is very reliable , no one would would be interested .

so i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller .
maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ?
hmm ?
if if i mean , uh i 'm sure if the user pays the same price , he 's happy to have recognition .
but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .
do you think they will be able to use gestures ?
where is the controller ?
mm .
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface .
um there 's three concepts in the user interface .
so first one it 's a google controller .
the second is a fancy controller .
the last one is uh intelligent controller .
so there are three concepts in our controller .

the second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts .
so what 's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?
there 's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
a microphone maybe .
but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
a nice one .
yeah , so wood .
--------------------
Ref:
the project manager put forward that the speech recognition would n't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time , and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies .
in response to that , the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited , so it would n't cost much .
then the project manager posed the language problem .
the user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries .
finally , there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer proposed to design a fashion remote control with a classic pushbutton like this one , or a button like lcd where the buttons are unlighted during the night .
project manager agreed and suggested that the control should be reliable and not too expensive too .
industrial designer also suggested to make it in wood , even if it was not completely wood .
marketing supplemented that fancy look and feel was the main point from the trend in fashion , so the team agreed to go with this design .
in the end , they discussed the design of what is inside and what are the different component of the product .
--------------------
topk:
okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion .
and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
and fruit and vegetables yeah .
not too expensive too .
let 's go to the industrial designer .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .
no one would would be interested .
so it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood interface concept .
no .
some some efficient .
but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you .
yeah , but and it is a kind of other design , i mean .
it can also be interesting to have this kind of { disfmarker } this .
i think he need a control that is very reliable ,
--------------------
Ref:
the discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material , alimentation , and chip .
the industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with lcd so that people could see the controller in dark .
in terms of the alimentation , it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation .
considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use , the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough , which was agreed by the group .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group decided to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design .
project manager pointed out that the regular battery would add a little bit of the price to the remote control , while the solar battery was an added value and was not too expensive too .
industrial designer agreed and added that it would be good to have both of them , so for example in some country where you were in the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities , then if you have electric if they put it on the sun and after one hour you could come back .
--------------------
topk:
alrigh in fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it 'll it will add a little bit of the price , and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , yeah .
solar .
or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .
and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
some some efficient .
and so .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example .
yeah , i think it 's an added value to the remote control 'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
not too expensive too .
case .
so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .
so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , interface concept .
no .
with a module ?
you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use yeah , they can not speak at the same time .
let 's go to the industrial designer .
yeah , for the interface something added value .
yeah , maybe we can first come to
--------------------
Ref:
with the solar energy alimentation , people in remote areas could recharge the controller more conveniently .
plus , it might attract some ecologists to purchase .
although the design would increase the production cost , it would be added value that can be compensated .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer proposed that the material of the remote control should be spongy rubber , wood or plastic .
the team agreed on rubber because it was a nice one .
however , industrial designer pointed out that it depended on the materials , if they have a wooden material it can be more common and the plastic material is more expensive .
in the end , they decided to use plastic because of its light weight and fruit-like appearance .
besides , rubber was cheap and easy to transport and users could see easily .
--------------------
topk:
or , you know , you can see them in the darkness .
so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , a microphone maybe .
yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood the then nn let 's go to the industrial designer .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
so it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common and fruit and vegetables yeah .
'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
this .
a nice one .
yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .
and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come yeah , working design , spongy 'kay .
and so .
case .
so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris
--------------------
Ref:
the group decided to use wood partly instead of plastic because they wanted to put fashion in electronics and wood was a good option .
by contrast , the plastic material was more common , impersonal , and not so high class as wood .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing thought fancy look and feel was the most important feature of the remote control , followed by technologically innovative and easy to use .
industrial designer thought the control needed to be reliable and not too expensive too .
user interface agreed and proposed to have confidence in technology .
project manager thought voice or gesture recognition was also a must .
however , users were not only interested in having speech recognition , but also in being free from any object .
the team agreed to add this feature on the next software update .
--------------------
topk:
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
we should have confidence in technology .
{ vocalsound } this .
i think he need a control that is very reliable , interface concept .
no .
okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion .
uh thi this i mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting .
um user really really want a fancy look and feel .
they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay .
like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically 'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .
if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .
yeah , then present it later .
yeah , we should .
uh .
let 's go to the industrial designer .
not too expensive too .
some some efficient .
would some { disfmarker } no one would would be interested .
the then nn so ,

the marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis .
users would like to have a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one .
apart from that , they still wanted the product to be technologically innovative .
at the same time , being user-friendly was also important .
then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing recommended to do a short anal analysis of the remote control market and to have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general , so that they could meet the user requirements .
in addition , the marketing suggested to design a fancy look and feel design with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition .
also , they should combine this with fashion from milan and paris .
not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends , marketing believed that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is inspired by nature .
--------------------
topk:
now i if we look at fashion in general um okay .
wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .
but it 's still fashion .
okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion .
if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it 's easy easy to use , easy to use .
yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting .
um user really really want a fancy look and feel .
they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay .
like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically okay .
so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we 'll you will all have to work in in your direction .
so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .
yeah .
solar .
'cause it 's it 's really what people want .
even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three .
then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .
yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right .
and fruit and vegetables yeah .
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
the then nn so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris yeah , maybe we can first come to this .
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
you think it 's possible ?
remote control .
we need something that is international .
suppose we 're we want to sell it in france .
--------------------
Ref:
that year everything from clothes to shoes and furniture was inspired by fruits and vegetables so the marketing suggested taking that into account .
the marketing also mentioned that people wanted a spongy touch which meant the product might be partly wooden and partly rubber-made .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team reached a consensus that the remote control should meet the user requirements of fancy look and feel and be technologically innovative .
however , it should be reliable and not too expensive too .
in addition , the team decided to do an anal analysis of the market and to have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general before making a final decision on the product .
for each country , there would be different requirements , such as fruit and vegetables , wood , colour , material , buttons , speech recognition , etc .
--------------------
topk:
yeah .
uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
so , the then nn yeah , so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting .
um user really really want a fancy look and feel .
they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay .
like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically yeah , so .
no one would would be interested .
some some efficient .
i think he need a control that is very reliable , and i not too expensive too .
case .
this .
yeah , so wood .
yeah , but for each country you have to do one , and fruit and vegetables yeah .
but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on .
would some { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
to meet the requirements of being fashionable and spongy , the group decided to use wood and rubber to make the controller .
maybe the part that users touched , such as the buttons , would be rubber , and the rest would be wooden , which would feel natural .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the mechanical functions of the remote control .
firstly , industrial designer introduced two basic functions which were input and location functions .
the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv .
and also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the screen to send a signal to a remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the location was .
so the components we need are an energy source to power the device , an input which would probably be buttons , a processor to take the information , something to transmit it , and a sender for location signal .
--------------------
topk:
uh-huh , and then press function .
and that 's another thing they complained about .
'cause we need to wrap up .
like in terms of okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .
um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the tv .
and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the tv and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the tv , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .
and also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we 'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their tv or stick it on their wall .
and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .
power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the tv .
and then for that was that was me .
um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .
so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .
they 're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .
and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order .
channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
the other ones are the settings , and they 're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .
um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .
and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i do n't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example would n't actually pay for this sort of thing .
um i do n't i do n't they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .
and okay so basically um i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .
um so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough i 'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv .
does it have like capacity to change the channels ?
um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ?
and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wan na do that ?
and um i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but and i think we can find something that 's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , okay , um .
in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .
um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .
custome customers and users do n't like the way remote controls look , they do n't like the way they feel , they do n't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there 's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons .
easy to lose , and r_s_i_ .
i do n't know what r_s_i_ means .
um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i do n't have a clue .
i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like .
so { disfmarker } the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .
so .
yeah but it it would be { disfmarker } yeah .
yeah should be { disfmarker } they 're not , no .
uh function f_ eight .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
so it 'll be moving around .
but then { disfmarker } locator .
--------------------
Ref:
the meeting started by discussing the functional design of the remote control .
marketing gave the study on user needs and target groups .
user interface gave the presentation on technical effect design and industrial designer gave the presentation on working design .
then project manager initiated new project requirements brainstorming .
the group had agreed on the on-call button design , dvd capability button design , power button design , and denied speech recognition design as well as mouse pad design .
they would further discuss the function switch button and its compatibility in the next meeting .

welcome everybody .
um hope your sessions went well .
um so this is our functional design meeting , we 're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
um i 've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i 'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there 's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .
um i i 'll get the ones up for next time , um they 're not finished yet .
right .
um so can we have updates from everyone from what you 've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you 'd like to share or discuss in this { disfmarker } and that 's another thing they complained about .
uh function f_ eight .
sure .
so but i 'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you 're if you 're on tv , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you 're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different i mean do we need to think about that , scrolling i do n't know .
like in terms of that was that was me .
the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .
so .
well i they 're not , no .
and uh but then { disfmarker } yeah , yeah .
yeah .
then it can live anywhere .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager stated the meeting topic on function design .
firstly , marketing concluded a study on user needs , including buttons for channel selection according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button , and suggested targeting on the nineteen to thirty-five years old age group to design functions .
next , user interface presented on the technical effect on what functions users need and how to make the best functions for users .
then , industrial designer presented the working design , including input a channel or volume setting and output the location function to the television .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that the finder button should be sold separately because if the sender 's on the remote then it would have to be found first to click the button to find the phone .
the call button could be pressed by someone calling it and it started ringing somewhere and then they could figure out that it was in the couch or wherever .
in terms of the power button , project manager thought they should have numbers and numbers on it so that users could find it easily .
industrial designer thought the signal would be like a radio signal like on a cell phone , so it beeps when it hears a signal .
--------------------
topk:
it would have to be sold separately because if the sender 's on the remote then you 'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .
yeah , it 'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it 's in the couch or wherever .
and that 's another thing they complained about .

um i do n't i do n't uh function f_ eight .
i guess .
so we definitely want a power button and numbers .
right .
sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
'kay so we 'll try to zip through this , since we 're short on time .
welcome everybody .

right .
um so can we have updates from everyone from what you 've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you 'd like to share or discuss in this { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } uh-huh , and then press function .
sure .
the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .
so .
yeah .
yeah and then .
yeah you click the button , it 's gon na send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it 's not gon na work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
like in terms of and uh
--------------------
Ref:
at the first beginning of the discussion , industrial designer mentioned that it would be easy to implement something like a buzzer to trace the remote location .
project manager suggested a two-part package - on one hand , users could click the button on the tv to send out the signal ; on the other hand , the remote base could beep probably so that users could know where the remote control has gone .

marketing made a list of the buttons that should focus on in order of importance .
the most important buttons were those to do with channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
they were used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .
people like to zap a lot and the other ones were the settings .
some people were more willing than others to actually pay for speech recognition .
user interface thought that it was an interesting idea .
project manager thought it might be a little pricey .

um so can we have updates from everyone from what you 've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you 'd like to share or discuss in this { disfmarker } make it fashionable .
um , okay .
okay .
um .
this my presentation about the uh technical functions design and i basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .
so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet .
it 's it 's funny like you f like i just i do n't have an ipod but like i , you know , i just like started messing around with one of my friend 's the other day , and you just sort of and it 's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it 's not that hard , you know .
sure .
and screen .
that 's only for speech recognition and screen .
they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .
i was thinking about that but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
so we get to design that too .
that was that was me .
yeah , yeah .
i think that 's an interesting idea , 'cause it 's cool , and that 's another thing they complained about .
so but i 'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you 're if you 're on tv , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you 're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different i mean do we need to think about that ,
--------------------
Ref:
marketing suggested the speech recognition design is for user groups aged from nineteen to thirty-five .
industrial designer supplemented the feature design that if the tv is on and somebody says like one , then the tv would switch itself to channel one .
however , project manager illustrated that considering the budget , to have the speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be expensive .
and this ended up was commonly agreed by other group mates .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface proposed to add a vcr / vhr / dvd capability button on the remote control .
project manager thought it would be better if there were two buttons , one for tv and the other for the finder .
industrial designer agreed and suggested a scrolling sort of button .
user interface then proposed a little thingy like a scroll wheel , which could be used to scroll through channels .
the team agreed on this idea and decided to make it into a function f eight .
then they discussed some new project requirements that came in .
teletext was apparently outdated due to internet popularity , so that 's off the list .
--------------------
topk:
like in terms of and okay so basically um i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .
um so i think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough i 'm not sure we c i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the tv .
does it have like capacity to change the channels ?
um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ?
and then , is it findable , and uh how do we wan na do that ?
and um i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um i dunno if this will work but and i think we can find something that 's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .
so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .
they 're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .
and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order .
channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
the other ones are the settings , and they 're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .
um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .
and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i do n't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example would n't actually pay for this sort of thing .
um i do n't i do n't uh function f_ eight .
also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television .
um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let 's be fashionable i guess .
um if we have something i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .
okay .
um .
so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .
um , yeah .
do let 's { disfmarker } and that 's another thing they complained about .
okay , um .
in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .
um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .
custome customers and users do n't like the way remote controls look , they do n't like the way they feel , they do n't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there 's a study of the buttons that they use most and i think we should design according to these buttons .
easy to lose , and r_s_i_ .
i do n't know what r_s_i_ means .
um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i do n't have a clue .
well i that was that was me .
but then { disfmarker } the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing .
so .
okay .
you need the little thingy .
ooh .
they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .
like you could just have { disfmarker } you may need to { disfmarker } yeah .
yeah .
okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .
okay .
well thank you everybody .
um we have we 'll discuss that and then i just wan na mention some new project requirements that came in .
um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that 's off the list .
um , yeah .
okay .
so is our target group then people so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
we have n't decided on an order .
'kay so we 'll try to zip through this , since we 're short on time .
welcome everybody .
um hope your sessions went well .
um so this is our functional design meeting , we 're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
um i 've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and i 'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there 's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .
um i i 'll get the ones up for next time , um they 're not finished yet .
right .
um so can we have updates from everyone from what you 've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you 'd like to share or discuss in this { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
project manager mentioned that the group needed to decide on the vcr capabilities and answered industrial designer 's question on whether vcrs were the same across the world .
so industrial designer suggested a whole different set of buttons for individual vcrs .
project manager suggested dvd type if considering the target group as young professionals and teenagers .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the conceptual model of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced the prototype , which had a speech recognition feature , an integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit , scroll wheels , advanced chip , and hard hard buttons .
then , user interface and industrial designer gave a presentation on the working design of remote controls based on market research results and user requirements .
after that , the group discussed some technical details , such as the chip size , processor type , channel number , etc .
finally , they discussed whether to make use of lcd display or not .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
and the channels as well .
so we 're going to talk about the conceptual model .
that 's better prob then uh some more technical things .
yeah , yeah .
okay .
that was this ?
and the led .
they can choose .
that 's pretty much it .
so the colours also .
yeah , more .
advanced chip .
but i it is it is it is already fancy .
because of the lights on the bottom of it .
that 's already fancy .
yeah , scroll wheels um { disfmarker } user interface concept .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
okay .
and speech recognition ?
which w with the hard hard buttons .
--------------------
Ref:
this meeting was about the functional design of the remote control .
firstly , marketing gave a presentation on the remote control market trend and suggested a fancy look as well as technology innovation features .
secondly , user interface presented on technical function design and recommended changeable fonts on remote buttons and a modern look with a handheld shape .
thirdly , industrial designer presented on component design and suggested a soft material case with flashy colors and transparent buttons .
industrial designer thought the normal infrared led should be sufficient .
lastly , the group discussed the remote 's features and they decided to have features including normal battery , scroll wheel , round shape , and speech recognition .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
according to the market research , fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative .
and then there is a point of discussion about whether to make use of lcd or speech recognition .
in the end , the team decided to use the former because it was more user-friendly and the latter because of its soft materials and advanced chip technology .
besides , it would be a good fit with the company 's existing product range .
--------------------
topk:
so i took uh that part of the webpage .
and it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .
this trends i th uh trend i think it 's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .
but it 's about uh clothes and shoes .
this ?
and the led .
those two , yeah .
they can choose .
like mobile phones .
like uh the ipod .
no rubber buttons or something .
just together with the back-lights you 'll get a totally new look .
more like the m_p_ three player m_ um p_ m_ p_ three player .
rubber spongy .
advanced chip .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
so the colours also .
user interface concept .
compared to { disfmarker } more rounded .
you have to choose { disfmarker } you have to look at that image of the ipod .
to use { disfmarker } but normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
could .
uh soft materials .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing gave the presentation on the remote control market .
marketing suggested that the first most important aspect of remote controls should be with a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel .
and the second most important aspect was that a remote control should be technologically innovative .
lastly , marketing suggested the spongy material and colour fronts .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing thought that spongy and fruity remote control was a trendy trend in the market and compared to last year 's feel of material , the feel was expected to be soft and spongey .
however , it would not be easy to use due to the fact that users drop their remote controls very often on the ground .
marketing also pointed out that the target group was young and trendy , so it was unlikely that they would want to spend a lot of money on such a product .
--------------------
topk:
spongy .
rubber spongy .
spongy .
which w yeah , i 'll get back on that .
spongy and fruity .
it 's like a sponge .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
spongy , like sponge .
compared to { disfmarker } we have to use uh kind of flashy colours , i think .
but the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .
just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh yeah , i dun dunno .
we have to discuss about that .
uh y yeah .
main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .
yeah , how do we do that ?
maybe speech ?
we ma must have some kind of gadget .
features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .
and that 's very hard i think .
uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .
but uh that was an overall uh point .
we already discussed that .
um i 've got one picture .
uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
because you 've you 're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .
so it has to be flexible .
so rubber , kind of .
those two , yeah .
and a flashy light .
this ?
soft , sponge .
--------------------
Ref:
when user interface asked the group how to make the spongy remote , marketing thought about changeable fronts and some basic colour fronts because a fancy look was the most important thing for remote control .
so they could make five different fronts to start with .
marketing also mentioned that it could be round , different from a normal remote control .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface recommended to go more to the ipod and m_p three players .
mobile phones were the modern remote controls of the moment .
users could make different fronts on it , like a mobile phone , so it would be easier to find the remote control .
also , the speech recognition function could be integrated in the chip , making it more user-friendly .
there were even more possibilities now with speech .
so they recommended using it .
user interface also suggested putting the volume on the side , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute button , and a text tv button .
--------------------
topk:
like mobile phones .
like uh the ipod .
user interface concept .
and the channels as well .
which w yeah , they have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech .
so they recommended using it .
we just talked about it looks .
has to look nice .
usability is very important .
people do n't want to spend money on something that 's similar to cheaper ones .
um it has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
light switches on if you use a button .
uh text tv still has to be a possibility .
and it has to be easy to learn .
that were the things i uh make minutes of .
and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text tv button .
that are the functions .
that right ?
uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said .
we have to be original and uh technological innovative .
becau yeah okay .
so we well we can i had uh to make a sort of a design .
so i did some searching on the internet .
i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players .
mobile phones .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
those two , yeah .
yeah , uh i dunno .
but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones .
features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .
and that 's very hard i think .
uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .
but uh that was an overall uh point .
we already discussed that .
um i 've got one picture .
uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
no .
yeah , it well that 's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that 's in it .
yeah , i 'll get back on that .
you can just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .
to use { disfmarker } i think in middle .
yeah , maybe it 's not easy if it 's below .
it 's harder to zap .
so i think uh it should be should be easy to .
i think it 's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
by just putting the volume on the side .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface recommended the speech recognition when marketing asked how to do with technological innovation because user interface knew from the technology department that they had done research about it and recommended using speech .
and user interface would also check with the technology department on how to do that .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface proposed to make the remote control bigger and a bit smaller , with changeable fonts and back-lights .
project manager agreed and suggested a flashing flashing light .
user interface also suggested to skip the speech recognition function and to use a home station kind of thing .
industrial designer thought that a hard hard button would be better .
marketing thought a see-through one in a fruit front was better because it 's hot .
finally , the group agreed to add a scroll wheel and plastic case .
--------------------
topk:
with the hard hard buttons .
that 's a little problem , of course , as well .
and we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .
{ gap } user interface concept .
but we already have the flashing flashing light on the { disfmarker } we just talked about it looks .
has to look nice .
usability is very important .
people do n't want to spend money on something that 's similar to cheaper ones .
um it has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
light switches on if you use a button .
uh text tv still has to be a possibility .
and it has to be easy to learn .
that were the things i uh make minutes of .
and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text tv button .
that are the functions .
that right ?
to use { disfmarker } no rubber buttons or something .
just together with the back-lights you 'll get a totally new look .
more like the m_p_ three player m_ um p_ m_ p_ three player .
and the led .
we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .
those two , yeah .
they can choose .
yeah .
but with all with logo on it .
and a flashy light .
basic remote control from normal plastic , yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .
because it 's uh it 's hot .
and the channels as well .
more modern .
y yes .
um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .
'cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides .
and here you just have one , few buttons .
so that 's that 's the main difference .
but looks uh i definitely think we should go like this .
and then changeable fonts , so { disfmarker } no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .

it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
--------------------
Ref:
the group decided to have the normal batteries , the scroll wheel with rubber buttons together with back-lights , the beeping of the home station , the round shape as well as the speech recognition with an advanced chip .
and they would skip the lcd because they would need the most expensive chip if they used an lcd .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought that the shape of the remote could be like a nokia , like plastic .
it would be okay if they just kept it a bit square .
however , project manager did not want it to be too big or too small , so he suggested that they could make some basic colour fronts and make five different fronts to start with or something like that .
in the end , they decided to keep it the same as the normal remote control , with a scroll-wheel on the outside .
--------------------
topk:
of the remote control ?
compared to { disfmarker } so you could put it like that , and still trans and the led .
shapes .
square .
like .
and uh some basic uh colour fronts .
uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something .
uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .
uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .
looking , i think .
'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .
it it could be like a nokia , like plastic .
we just talked about it looks .
has to look nice .
usability is very important .
people do n't want to spend money on something that 's similar to cheaper ones .
um it has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
light switches on if you use a button .
uh text tv still has to be a possibility .
and it has to be easy to learn .
that were the things i uh make minutes of .
and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text tv button .
that are the functions .
that right ?
the function of that in there .
yeah .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
that 's better prob advanced chip .
okay , the component design .
i looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .
so uh this was on the web site .
if you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .
so flashy kinda colours .
uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes .
not nothing square-like .
is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ?
yeah , just where you 're around something .
li yeah , we had one example .
i think it 's okay if you just keep it a bit square .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing and user interface suggested the group could choose the shape of the remote either like an ipod square or a more innovative round shape .
project manager thought they should choose a round shape with rounded corners , instead of looking like an ipod so that would be more innovative .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface suggested using a regular chip or an advanced chip inside the speech recognition .
industrial designer thought it would be more expensive if they used an lcd .
project manager agreed and pointed out that the chip-on-print was a normal one , while the advanced one would cost more .
user interface then proposed to use an integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit , which was integrated in the remote chip , so if users used the regular one they would have to pay more for the function .
--------------------
topk:
advanced chip .
i do n't know what it is , but it should be there i think .
and uh the lcd .
so we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an lcd .
no .
yeah , it well that 's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that 's in it .
they can choose .
user interface concept .
yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
oh i got an email uh and it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .
and um they say uh a display requires an advanced chip .
and this is more expensive than all the other chips .
so which w okay .
and speech recognition ?
yeah okay .
so we well we can i had uh to make a sort of a design .
so i did some searching on the internet .
i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players .
mobile phones .
no .
okay well i received an email okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition .
okay .
the chip-on-print is a normal one .
so the colours also .
the function of that in there .
yeah .
of the remote control ?
we have to decide on that .
but normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
could .
and the led .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing emphasized on the importance of technology innovation .
so project manager suggested putting the speech recognition in the remote directly and they would need an advanced chip .
the group agreed on it and industrial designer supplemented that the division had developed a new and inexpensive speech recognition feature : the integrated programmable sample sensor , indicating that the cost would not be too much .

==================================================
Pred:
project manager started the meeting by introducing the new product they are going to develop , a television remote control .
it should be original , trendy and user-friendly .
then , project manager asked the team to generate some ideas about how the remote should look and function .
after that , industrial designer , user interface designer and marketing expert each gave a presentation on their respective roles in the project .
the group then discussed some details of the prototype , including the working design and the functional design .
finally , they discussed the profit target for the product and decided to set a price of twenty-five euros .
--------------------
topk:
um project kick-off .
it it should be a cat .
okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
um any questions well , just just let me know .
um okay , back to our project .
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros .
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite a number .
um well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud 's uh role .
um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh roo uh r uh during this part .
um so let 's start with you .
um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it 's a remote control , a television remote control .
um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .
those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and i 'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
see you in thirty minutes .
um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that .
um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ?
well in this case control t the the television i think .
so we will go back to our own uh work .
um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
um so this was it .
okay , the waiting is for our marketing expert , ruud .
um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
which makes it easier to operate it .
the market , we should have a look at the market .
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes .
um you can choose the format , um sorry .
uh let me see .
um well i guess it 's maybe because i 'm not s uh pen selected .
yep .
current colour , you can choose another colour .
and um for example black , and you c i can choose the line width .
um so now i d have a different line width and uh colour .
okay .
quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me .
um to um oh well , i 'm i wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us .
um as a little training um i will ask ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .
{ vocalsound } um and the last one is the working design .
how exactly does it work in the technical sense .
um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .
so we 'll kop it keep it with the functional design .
okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .
um as you see now i can give a presentation .
um it 's also possible to use this one as well .
you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .
um to um presentate , to show us uh a file you 'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .
um then we have this electronic white-board system .
um yeah , i will show that now .
um you can draw on the board using this pen .
there are little um uh but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it .
um you are here in a specific role .
uh ruud is here as the marketing expert , roo is here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here uh in the role of industrial designer .
is that correct ?
yeah , great .
it 's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras .
okay .
okay .
um we 're here to develop uh a new product .
sebastian is thinking about the animal .
and uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
--------------------
Ref:
this is the kick-off meeting of the new television remote control project .
the team got acquainted with each other and project manager described the scope of the project .
industrial designer claimed that he could support any practical ideas technically and proposed that they could make an interoperable remote control .
user interface agreed and pointed out that people changed the state of the tv by pressing the button .
then he proposed that people should be able to feel the buttons without having to look at them and the buttons should be visible in dark .
in terms of the way to connect the remote control to the tv , industrial designer suggested that infrared could be substituted by bluetooth .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer suggested that the remote control should be able to control a diverse subset of equipment , for instance , dvd players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
project manager agreed and asked the team to take these things into account when they started the discussion about the functional design .
industrial designer also proposed some new technical possibilities which might be interesting to implement in the product , such as interoperabi interoperability between different types of remote controls .
user interface then proposed to design a white button with a black mark on it , which would make it easier to operate .
--------------------
topk:
well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
and uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
um project kick-off .
that 's it .
well , it can be for design , of course .
it it should be a cat .
um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that .
um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ?
well in this case control t the the television i think .
um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it 's a remote control , a television remote control .
um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .
those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and i 'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
um and the last one is the working design .
how exactly does it work in the technical sense .
um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .
so we 'll kop it keep it with the functional design .
okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .
um as you see now i can give a presentation .
um it 's also possible to use this one as well .
you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .
um to um presentate , to show us uh a file you 'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .
um then we have this electronic white-board system .
um yeah , i will show that now .
um you can draw on the board using this pen .
there are little um uh okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
um any questions well , just just let me know .
um okay , back to our project .
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros .
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite a number .
um the market , we should have a look at the market .
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes .
um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
which makes it easier to operate it .
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .
one thing about uh interopera operability .
um i think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment .
uh for instance , uh d_v_d_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
so one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
and the way of communicating with these equipments .
it 's over ?
h how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud 's uh role .
um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh roo uh r uh during this part .
um so let 's start with you .
you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
okay ?
okay .
um first about my role , role of the industrial designer .
i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh i 'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities .
so that 's one .
uh i also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same .
sorry about that .
um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .

yeah , with buttons .
um you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .

well , it can be for design , of course .
you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
uh is that uh are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?
so when you 're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
and the way of communicating with these equipments .
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .

um so let 's start with you .
h how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
it it should be a cat .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface agreed with industrial designer and supposed that the remote control could be interoperable .
that is to say , it could be a universal remote control that fits every device .

he also suggested that there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them so that they could communicate with each other .
in addition , he thought it would be nice if a user could see functions on the screen , which makes it easier to operate it .
infrared was not suitable for this function because it interfered with the infrared signal , so the range was limited .

it it should be a cat .
i think it could come in handy .
we should discuss that .
um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .
we 're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh

Ref:
industrial designer believed that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment .
that means , one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment .

project manager agreed .
user interface pointed out that all tvs are equipped with infrared and bluetooth , so it would be nice to have some interoperabi interoperability between them .
then the group discussed how to make the connection between the two devices .
industrial designer proposed some implementations for that , but there might be some impossibilities .

yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah .
for tv , you 're always in in the neighbourhood of a tv , so i do n't think think the range should be a problem to that , um project kick-off .
okay ?
okay .
um first about my role , role of the industrial designer .

um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros .
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite a number .
um no , the cost price is very low .
yes , i think it should be something like that .
but all the tvs are uh equipped with infrared , so okay , so we 're we 're going business to consumer , it 's over ?
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer pointed out that infrared connection is old-fashioned so they should choose a novel one , such as bluetooth .
project manager added that the device should be rechargeable and not consume too much power .

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer suggested that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment , for instance , dvd players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them , so that users could switch between channels or change between tracks on a cd or cd player , on the tv , etc .
he also proposed some implementations for that , but there were some impossibilities .
new technical possibilities were also available and which might be interesting to implement in the product .
--------------------

yes , i think it should be something like that .
well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
um we 're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here .

sorry about that .
um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .
and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers .
um then the discussion , maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation .
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .
one thing about uh interopera operability .
um i think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment .
uh for instance , uh d_v_d_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
so one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
um and the last one is the working design .
how exactly does it work in the technical sense .
um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .
so we 'll kop it keep it with the functional design .
okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .
um as you see now i can give a presentation .
um it 's also possible to use this one as well .
you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .

there are little um uh um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
which makes it easier to operate it .
um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it 's a remote control , a television remote control .

well in this case control t the the television i think .
okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
um any questions well , just just let me know .
um okay , back to our project .
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros .
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite a number .
um the market , we should have a look at the market .
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes .
to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a c_d_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a d_v_d_ player .
so maybe that 's an idea , and the way of communicating with these equipments .
well , cell phones have uh integrated bluetooth also and , well , it 's it seems to work uh quite okay .
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud 's uh role .
um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh roo uh r uh during this part .
um so let 's start with you .
um project kick-off .
that 's it .
yeah .
well , maybe i um but it it can be quite simple , so that 's right .
ruud .

Ref:
industrial designer proposed to change the way how the remote control and the tv communicate with each other as the infrared connection was not hot technical and suggested using bluetooth .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface pointed out that bluetooth was not suitable for the remote control because it was incompatible with infrared technology , which was used in the nineteen eighties and nineties .
infrared was the standard for tv remote controls then , and users could not feel the buttons without looking at them .
also , users had to know what they do without infrared buttons , so it should be as user interface put it , good to understand .
industrial designer agreed and proposed to discuss how these things should communicate with each other .
--------------------

but you ca n't you ca n't use bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .
yes , i think it should be something like that .
um you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .
well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
i think it could come in handy .
we should discuss that .
um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .
we 're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh you should equip infrared and bluetooth together in one remote .
the market , we should have a look at the market .
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes .
um and the last one is the working design .
how exactly does it work in the technical sense .
um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later .
so we 'll kop it keep it with the functional design .
okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .
um as you see now i can give a presentation .
um it 's also possible to use this one as well .
you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .
um to um presentate , to show us uh a file you 'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be .
um then we have this electronic white-board system .
um yeah , i will show that now .
um you can draw on the board using this pen .
there are little um uh um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that .
um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ?
well in this case control t the the television i think .
okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
um any questions well , just just let me know .
um okay , back to our project .
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros .
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite a number .
um um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it 's a remote control , a television remote control .
um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .
those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and i 'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
okay ?
okay .
um first about my role , role of the industrial designer .
i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh i 'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities .
so that 's one .
uh i also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same .
sorry about that .
um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
yeah .
but then bluetooth uh might be problem .
um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
which makes it easier to operate it .
h how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
those are two really uh user interface { disfmarker } we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .
and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers .
um then the discussion , maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation .
um project kick-off .
so we will go back to our own uh work .
um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
um so this was it .
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .
one thing about uh interopera operability .
um i think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment .
uh for instance , uh d_v_d_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
so one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager believed that remote control should not consume too much power .
therefore , as the cellphone would consume power very quickly when the bluetooth was on , user interface was concerned that it might be a problem .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the user interface design of the remote control .
first of all , project manager introduced the new project requirements , which included the target group , the functions decided and the budget .
industrial designer then gave a presentation on the basic scheme for the design , including the chip , buttons , infrared diode , circuit board , power source , volume , zap button , lightning effects , glow in the dark , turning on and off the lights , as well as the voice recognition function .
the group then discussed the costs and agreed to set a budget of 12.5 million euros .
--------------------
topk:
like um turning on and off the the the lights .
well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .
and just about uh the user interface , i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
what should we choose in in design ?
okay .
i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented .
um basically this is all there is .
there 's just one chip .
there are a few buttons connected .
uh the buttons are lit .
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
so that 's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
they 're very cheap .
we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience .
the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .
um we have forty minutes .
so it 's now yep .
okay .
um the new project requirements , first of all , um we did n't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
it 's a board decision .
um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w interface industrial .
the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .
okay .
okay .
people , welcome back with the second meeting .
then we 'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last .
um the top goal of this m uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
um for now on the schedule are a few points .
uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now .
um second , i received um some new project requirements .
i 'm not sure if you received them as well , um but i will tell you about it .
or can we decide next meeting ?
uh yes .
alright .
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
okay , um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and i 'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it .
um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents folder .
if you want to look at it um well , just do .
um the interface designer , um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components concept .
no ?
well um , there 's a energy source here .
and um basically there it 's connected to three things .
the user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .
that 's basically the idea .
and there 's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look .
okay .
um what have i found .
usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .
that 's all .
it 's cased together , nothing more than that .
it 's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every tv set is controlled infrared .
--------------------
Ref:
this is the second meeting of the design group .
project manager introduced new project requirements at first .
the management required a remote control only for television and aimed at customers under 40. in terms of user interface design , user interface focused on user-friendliness but still thought multi-function should be considered .
industrial designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits .
he also suggested that they should use infrared so that the remote control could be connected with most tv sets .
after that , in order to solve the problem of energy source , the team decided to include a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface designer proposed to design an easy remote control with not so much buttons , just a volume and a programme to programme button and some fancy lights in the device that shone on all the buttons .
user interface also suggested to add a round button which can be pushed in four directions instead of a stick .
project manager agreed and the team decided to build in a feature to support audio signal like home phones .
industrial designer thought that the easiest way to do this was by sending pulses of infrared light to a tv set .
--------------------
topk:
interface industrial .
and the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
and just about uh the user interface , i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
oh , user-friendly .
that 's w w what we concluded .
it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .
s just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .
and um um yeah , some some fancy lights .
it 's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions .
instead of a stick .
it should be uh uh { disfmarker } yeah , i think it 's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , yeah , it 's of course it 's user interface , but um i i was talking about really the design of the { disfmarker } user interface designer , uh roo , i would like to see the user interface c uh concept .
just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness i uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .
some uh audio signal .
like uh home phones .
um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a tv set .
and the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a tv set .
well , i th i tried to uh implement a picture here , um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .
um we have forty minutes .
so it 's now yep .
okay .
um the new project requirements , first of all , um we did n't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
it 's a board decision .
um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience .
okay .
i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented .
um basically this is all there is .
there 's just one chip .
there are a few buttons connected .
uh the buttons are lit .
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
so that 's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
or uh oh , and just one function .
the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change well , the extra functions .
so that 's out of the question .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface introduced a remote control easy to use and a multi-functional one and preferred the former as it was more user-friendly .
industrial designer agreed and proposed that a stick or round button for volume control and channel selection could be used and also suggested that the ten digits could be substituted by voice recognition .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought that the ten digits would be costly and hard to implement , because when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you can not see it .
and elder people would n't like voice recognition .
so industrial designer suggested that they could use about ten buttons .
that 's enough for a regular tv user , and if they just want to watch the dutch television networks , well , they can use a few buttons and a sound signal , but it would become more costly also .
--------------------
topk:
because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um { disfmarker } by um i mean nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .
just elder elder people would would buy it , so maybe that 's a possibility , but i 'm afraid it will be a bit costly .
it is .
i would n't buy it personally .
a remote control without the ten digits .
interface industrial .
you 're the secretary .
{ vocalsound } uh yes .
alright .
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
um and it will become more costly also .
well , it 's this till true , of course .
that they only use ten percent the buttons .
the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time .
and the volume button 's only four times .
so they 're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .
and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control .
well , the technical uh there i think there are no technical difficulties .
there 's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .
so um i do n't think we have any hiccups there .
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .
so maybe it 's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
and um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it .
uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for { disfmarker } and it 's very easy uh to find your remote control .
especially elder people uh do n't like voice recognition .
so then we should implement such a but so that 's that 's a big advantage , i think .
well , i i think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you can not see it .
'cause when { disfmarker } but if you 're uh a regular tv user , and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons .
that 's enough .
okay .
i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented .
um basically this is all there is .
there 's just one chip .
there are a few buttons connected .
uh the buttons are lit .
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
so that 's basically the total design of this piece of equipment .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer thought the ten buttons looked a bit dull so speech recognition could be added to solve this problem .
but he was concerned that power saving could be difficult when implementing speech recognition .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface thought that the ease-of-use remote control should be easy to use with less possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons .
the multi-function could be implemented in the design , but teletext buttons were not in their design .
so it should take out eight buttons or so .
in user interface 's opinion , the easy-to use r_c was the best possi possibility for them to make a nice design when there was not too much buttons in it .
--------------------
topk:
we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
and if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .
yeah , it 's of course it 's user interface , but um i i was talking about really the design of the { disfmarker } uh yes .
alright .
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
yes , yes .
well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , interface industrial .
oh , user-friendly .
so maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design .
but it should b i think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design .
so it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .
but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
it 's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions .
instead of a stick .
yeah , i think it 's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a tv set .
and the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a tv set .
well , i th i tried to uh implement a picture here , it should be uh uh { disfmarker } that 's w w what we concluded .
it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons .
s just a a p a p a volume and a programme one .
and um um yeah , some some fancy lights .
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .
um we have forty minutes .
so it 's now yep .
okay .
um the new project requirements , first of all , um we did n't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
it 's a board decision .
um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w and just about uh the user interface , i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .

so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .
so maybe it 's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
oh , and just one function .
the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah .
just through uh the easy uh design .
we can make uh a nice design when when there 's not mu uh much buttons in it .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface found two kinds of remote controls : the multi-functional one and the one easy to use .
he emphasized on user-friendliness , but considering that the target people were less than forty years old , multi-function should also be taken into account .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that the remote control should only be used for television , because teletext was out of date and internet was replacing it .
it was not feasible to implement it in the product .
also , the voice recognition function should n't be integrated because it depended on the decisions sebastian made about the division of the decisions .
the group decided to build in a feature to support audio signal like home phones .
they also agreed to use energy-saving , rechargeable , friendly components .
--------------------
topk:
so that 's out of the question .
um and it will become more costly also .
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .
some uh audio signal .
like uh home phones .
interface industrial .
well , the technical uh there i think there are no technical difficulties .
there 's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .
so um i do n't think we have any hiccups there .
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .
so maybe it 's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes .
about the voice recognition .
it can be costly .
maybe not .
and just about uh the user interface , i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .

so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
it 's a board decision .
um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w sound signal .
there are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .
uh yes .
alright .
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
so well , this uh should be it .
or a find a finding function , they 're very cheap .
so what about the clapping technique ?
um because you se but it should n't be integrated { disfmarker } uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components .
uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components .
and um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .
um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .
like um turning on and off the the the lights .
and um
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most tv sets .
he also proposed to use energy-friendly components and save the cost of circuit boards to develop elaborate lighting techniques .
in order to prevent people from losing the remote control , the team decided to implement an audio signal .
in terms of energy source , the team preferred to have a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team came up with a solution to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project .
project manager suggested that the remote control should have a p newspaper over it , so that customers could not see it when they were looking for it .
user interface supplemented that people would n't bother walking to the tv and pressing that button because they lost the control .
industrial designer disagreed with this idea , pointing out that it would become more costly and time-consuming if customers had to find it themselves .
--------------------
topk:
well , i i think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you can not see it .
interface industrial .
well , the extra functions .
well if you lost th often .
it can be costly .
maybe not .
well , it 's this till true , of course .
that they only use ten percent the buttons .
the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time .
and the volume button 's only four times .
so they 're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .
and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control .
so that 's not a good idea .
so what about the clapping technique ?
um because you se to find yeah .
on the design .
used option .
um and it will become more costly also .
oh , user-friendly .
so that 's out of the question .
i do n't think people would bother walking to the tv and press that button because they lost the their remote .
yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .
uh yes .
alright .
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .
um we have forty minutes .
so it 's now yep .
okay .
um the new project requirements , first of all , um we did n't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
it 's a board decision .
um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w it is .
--------------------
Ref:
user interface proposed that a base station next to the tv could be a solution , but industrial designer pointed out that this could be technically complicated and would cost a lot .
so the team eventually adopted marketing 's advice to implement an audio signal .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
when discussing the energy source , industrial designer pointed out that there were specially designed energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components .
and if they wanted to use rechargeable design or a energy save design , they should implement them .
for cost-effectiveness , the team should use a very low-cost circuit board because most of the production cost were in this part of equipment .
project manager agreed and added that it should n't be a big issue .
user interface followed with the glow in the dark concept .
--------------------
topk:
there are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .
it is .
the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
well , i i think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you can not see it .
succeed in it also .

so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
in the market , yeah .
no ?
well um , there 's a energy source here .

Ref:
industrial designer proposed to incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries , but project manager agreed more with marketing 's proposal to include a cradle .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the evaluation of the product specification and prototype design .
firstly , marketing gave a presentation on the criteria that the team got from the market research , based on user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of marketing company .
then , industrial designer , user interface and project manager each gave their own individual rating on each criterion .
the final rating was a consensus rating between one and seven .
after that , the group went on to discuss the budget , which was set at 12.5 million euros .
finally , they discussed the design minimise repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) and be easy to locate .

this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
so this is the first stage of the evaluation .
now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .
so it 's what we 've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here .
the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
um and we 've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
so we are under the budget .
and we 'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it was n't uh uh gon na be a problem factor .
we wanted a stand-by function .
the case material is gon na be soft , rubbery , changeable .
um buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design .
um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .
okay ?
prototype presentation .
i think that was just the the physical .
plastic and rubber .
so should we just change the design specification then ?
{ vocalsound } okay , so the highest we 've got is the electronics here .
um and the interface .
and the buttons at the bottom would d they have to come from somewhere , do n't they ?
that part was nice and easy .
okay .
uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
two curves , yeah .
the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those .
i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , criteria and rating .
actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .
how about that ?
because just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
there are innovations in that that people do n't really want .
okay , yeah , we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
--------------------
Ref:
the team mainly planned the remote control project down to the last detail in the final meeting .
industrial designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top lcd touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom .
there would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization .
inside the remote control , there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery .
the team was under the budget at present .
once the budget increased , however , the voice recognition would be incorporated .
the remote control 's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members , but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough .
all members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing proposed to conduct a simulation market evaluation of the new remote control based on the criteria of user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of their company .
the group agreed to evaluate the product specification and prototype design on a seven point scale from one to seven , with one point being true and seven points being false .
they would take an average at the end for each criterion and make a decision on whether to produce the prototype and market it as a prototype or make further modifications .

the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
yeah , the the s a two .
we 've got our our we 've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there .
that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
so , would there be two ?
yeah .
i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
i think that would be you .
the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those .
i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , a plastic .
the average { disfmarker } you built into the feature .
we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
i would agree .
a standard .
an one .
criteria and rating .
actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end .
how about that ?
and now we 've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it was n't uh uh gon na be a problem factor .
we wanted a stand-by function .
the case material is gon na be soft , rubbery , changeable .
um buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design .
um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .
okay ?
prototype presentation .
and they 're double curved .
no .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing summarized the user requirements according to the market reports .
users expected a fancy look , technological innovation , and minimization of repetitive strain injury .
the team did a preliminary rating using a seven-point scale .
the results were that the remote control 's fashion style and location function were most highly rated , but the team was not satisfied enough with the minimization of repetitive strain injury .
the team agreed on further modifications to the current prototype .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing thought that the incorporation of current fashion trends in the prototype was borrowing from other areas , such as the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
however , he doubted if it would have made it into the final product if they had seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out .
he also doubted whether they could do much more to minimise the repetitive strain injury on the remote control , as it was high enough at the upper end of the scale for them to go ahead with that .
--------------------
topk:
it incorporates current fashion trends , now that 's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
and finally that 's how we put the fashion back into electronics , because the phones have moved on , things like that .
this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
so this is the first stage of the evaluation .
now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .

the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
of c yeah .
because just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
there are innovations in that that people do n't really want .
we 've got our our we 've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there .
that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?

okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those .
i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , because i 'm not gon na get into silly decimal places .
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it was n't uh uh gon na be a problem factor .
we wanted a stand-by function .
the case material is gon na be soft , rubbery , changeable .
um buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design .

um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .
okay ?
prototype presentation .
because of the produ mm .
and it still makes such an innovative item yeah .
i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
it 's really borrowing from other areas , it 's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , vegetables .
it would be .
i would agree .
i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , i think maybe it would 've come out a d little different , we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
um it would it would have obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
and uh because , obviously , all tvs use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have n't i do n't think we actually put it on .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing initially doubted that industrial designer was limited in the use of materials for the prototype , which would harm the fashion style .
marketing was soon convinced by industrial designer , however , that the changeable faces would allow users to customize their remote controls .
besides , the rubber case would give a spongy feel .
marketing thus rated one point for industrial designer 's style design .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing concluded that the minimization of repetitive strain injury was high enough at the upper end of the scale for the remote control to go ahead with production as a prototype and market it , even though on the basis of current technology and current capabilities , they could actually do much more to minimise that .
for example , the design should minimize r_s_i and be easy to locate and they were still ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also the though of having a beeper function .
--------------------

that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
because of the produ mm .

no .
yeah , it was { disfmarker } the average { disfmarker } a two .
'cause it 's two .
which is less than ten p_ .
it 's to be presented .
is that .
okay .
uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
--------------------
Ref:
marketing considered the design of pointers unfeasible , for many users were prone to zap .
project manager recommended the slight and small-sized buttons with more space in between .
regretfully , the team failed to come up with a perfectly feasible solution to the problem .
the team thus gave low rate points to the prototype 's minimization of repetitive strain injury .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team reached a consensus that the cost of the remote control should be 12.5 euros , which was within the budget .
however , they had to take into account the exchange range of 12 euros and 12 dollars .
they decided to use a standard chip , a stand-by function , soft case material , changeable buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design , bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
voice recognition software would be built into the feature set until they could find out more about cost .
the rubber buttons that they 'll use will be anti-rsi .
--------------------
topk:
so we are under the budget .
yeah we are close to the budget .
c it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in euros .
it could be in dollars .
and then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve .
i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
make it costly .
no i think rubber , since it 's being used just as a casing , this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
so this is the first stage of the evaluation .
now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .

um buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design .
um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .
okay ?
prototype presentation .
you built into the feature .
yeah , the the s four .
a two .
because just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
there are innovations in that that people do n't really want .
um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but i think i do n't know , d what do you think ?
do you think that 's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ?
and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .

i would agree .
a plastic .
it 's brought it down slightly .
um it would it would have obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
and uh because , obviously , all tvs use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have n't i do n't think we actually put it on .
--------------------
Ref:
the team calculated the cost of the remote control in the euro .
the team included one regular chip , one kinetic cell , one double-curved bottom , one push button , one lcd screen , as well as rubber and plastic materials .
the team decided to recommend voice recognition to business customers .
once the budget increased , voice recognition would be incorporated .
overall , the present cost was 12.5 euros and was under the budget .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface thought that instead of going for kinetic batteries , they could change the battery to a standard one instead , which would make one difference .
the biggest one would be taking away if they took away the energy source from the remote control , as it was costly to replace it with a new one .
and people are used to buying batteries for their televisions , so it would not be a big deal for them to switch to standard batteries .
user interface also pointed out that replacing the kinetic battery with standard ones would n't add much cost to the budget .
--------------------
topk:
it would be .
i think we could change the battery also .
instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
so this is the first stage of the evaluation .
now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .

the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
and working on the inside we 've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of { disfmarker } an one .
make it costly .
and people are used to buying batteries , i presume we 're good to go .
okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?

um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ .
okay ?
prototype presentation .
no .
yeah , it was { disfmarker } the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those .
i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , if we tr um .
if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they 'd also be quite cheap .
so you 'd have something like where you 'd shout out , where where is the remote and it 'll shout back , i 'm here , or something .
i think that would be you .
okay , you all switched on .
'cause it 's two .
yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference .
the biggest one would be taking away if you took away { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
user interface recommended the standard batteries to replace the kinetic batteries and lower the cost .
marketing was promised by user interface that the change in battery type would not make any big difference in shape and colours .
however , marketing was still uncertain about the replacement .
user interface further explained that users were used to paying little attention to batteries which were installed internally .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing pointed out that voice recognition sounds wonderful , but the object was so distinctive that it would make it easier to locate in a first instance .
project manager agreed and suggested that they could do it for business class or something , like an upgraded version .
industrial designer disagreed and said that if they took away the voice , the cost would be too high .
user interface agreed with marketing and proposed to incorporate it into the design until they found out more about cost of things like that .
prototype presentation showed that the case material was soft , rubbery , changeable and spongy .
buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber were bright funky designs inspired by fruit .

there are innovations in that that people do n't really want .
the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those .
i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far .
we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false .
we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gon na make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance .
um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers um it would it would have obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
and uh because , obviously , all tvs use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have n't i do n't think we actually put it on .
no .
yeah , it was { disfmarker } we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
so , i 'll work out the average for that again at the end .
it 's a very slightly altered okay , you built into the feature .
um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they 'd also be quite cheap .
so you 'd have something like where you 'd shout out , where where is the remote and it 'll shout back , i 'm here , or something .
they have to come from somewhere , do n't they ?
i think that would be you .
two .
--------------------
Ref:
industrial designer implicated that if the kinetic batteries were replaced by the standard batteries , the voice recognition would have to be taken away as well .
project manager , therefore , made a compromise that the team might provide the voice recognition in an upgraded version for the business class who expected high office specifications .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the functional design and conceptual design of the remote control .
firstly , project manager gave a presentation on the prototype , which was a simple presentation with some things in it .
then , marketing , user interface and industrial designer gave their presentations , respectively .
after that , the group discussed the user requirements , including the looks and the specification of buttons , and finally , they discussed how to make a profit of fifty million euros .
the production cost were about half the price of selling price , so the team decided to use a big market in europe .
--------------------
topk:
just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
and we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , that 's .
and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , so we have to uh use a big market in europe .
the production cost are about half the price of selling price , and how big should it be ?
but i do n't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .
yeah , everything okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .
we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting .
the the second thing is the conceptual design , that 's what it that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
and we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market .
and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever .
okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
um for m for me uh the marketing expert , the user requirements uh specification , do i need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the { disfmarker } rechargeable .
and { disfmarker } uh on on top are the the basic options on top , so i first uh draw the water .
folder , or a dog .
yeah , i think this if you you have to n know if it 's for s a tv , a d_v_d_ player , all that things .
also from a user , but all these things together .
it should n't be too big , i just made a a simple uh presentation .
so you put some things in it .
why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?
the water is important .

--------------------
Ref:
the meeting began with the project manager announcing the task and the agenda .
the group should design an original , trendy , and user-friendly remote control through the following meetings .
first of all , they did a brief equipment testing on their laptops , the pens , and the whiteboard to ensure they would work .
then getting to the main point of this meeting , the group talked about the budget and reached the agreement that it had to be a universal remote control with such a high price .
the group also discussed the functions , the shape and other external design of the remote design , as well as drawing them down as a conceptual draft .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group discussed the conceptual design of the remote control , including the functions and some possible advanced techniques .
user interface proposed to design a mouse-like interface with scroll wheels and a scroll wheel that could be used to scroll through channels on the screen .
project manager thought that a touchscreen interface would be more trendy and user-friendly .
industrial designer suggested to use a lcd screen instead of a slide-out one , which was rejected by marketing .
marketing also suggested that the on off button must be on top and the buttons on usable places .
--------------------
topk:
just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
uh on on top are the the basic options on top , two .
we 're gon na make a remote control .
and how big should it be ?
it should n't be too big , okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .
we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting .
the the second thing is the conceptual design , that 's what it that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
and we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market .
and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever .
okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
that you want on a { disfmarker } yeah , maybe it would .
uh i i set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , but i do n't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .
well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter .
um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons .
um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
okay , there are buttons on it .
maybe more trendy .
yes that one .
why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
universal .
mouse .
it 's just to get used to it .
--------------------
Ref:
in order to make a satisfying profit , the group had to set their price at 25 euros , which was relatively high .
for fear that the higher price would lead to fewer consumers , they decided to make it a universal remote control , being able to function on different tvs .
the group also planned to add a touchscreen onto the remote control and even include some games for children .
what ’ s more , they paid some attention to the energy source , whether it should be a rechargeable one or just use normal batteries .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought that a home station was a good idea because lots of people lose their remote control and do n't know where it is , so it would be easy for them to get used to it .
however , he did not think they could make it too small because it had to have a lot of functions .
he also mentioned that it was not too expensive to put a touchscreen on it because the production cost were about half the price of selling price , which was reasonable considering the profit potential .
--------------------
topk:
why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
what do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .
okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .

and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever .
okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
that 's .
and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , so we have to uh use a big market in europe .
the production cost are about half the price of selling price , just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
so can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , i dunno .
uh so we 're gon na have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls .
well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter .
um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons .
um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
we 're gon na make a remote control .
it 's just to get used to it .
there are buttons on it .
but i do n't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .
okay .
but it 's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
not just a tv .
yeah , or you c and we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?
yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and do n't know where it is , okay , mouse .
and how big should it be ?
--------------------
Ref:
when discussing the remote control , the group tried to set the price at 25 euros , which was relatively high , at least compared to the existing ones .
for fear that such a high price would lose their potential consumers , the project manager decided to aim their product at a universal one .
according to the project manager , only by making it a universal remote control and adding other unique characters could it attract more consumers , then eventually reaching their profit expectation .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the marketing thought that it would be too expensive to put a touchscreen on the remote control , so the industrial designer proposed to make it just in in typed words in word .
the project manager agreed , but the user interface disagreed , pointing out that they could do something unique with that .
in the end , the marketing put forward the idea of making it the same style as the television , without the touchscreen , which was rejected by the group as it was not trendy enough for the market at that time .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , maybe it would .
because { gap } okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .

okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
maybe more trendy .
yeah , it probably would be universal .
well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter .
um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons .
um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
we 're gon na make a remote control .
so you can do something unique with that .
that you want on a { disfmarker } uh i think it was uh { disfmarker } because i like uh okay .
yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?
okay .
but it 's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
yeah , i know , but i d i i thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in word , why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
so i { disfmarker } yes that one .
or { disfmarker } yeah , everything yeah .
like this ?
--------------------
Ref:
when discussing adding several advanced techniques onto the remote control to make it more unique , the industrial design put forward to using the touchscreen .
notwithstanding the merits of the touchscreen , for instance , a touch screen would make the remote control easier and smaller , the marketing did not agree to do so just because in that case they would be beyond the budget .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial design suggested to care for the strength of the remote control , so that it would be resistant to scratches and damage .
and how big should it be ?
industrial design also suggested that the buttons should be made of plastic or rechargeable , which would make it universal and easy to use .
in addition , industrial designer thought that a home station was a really good idea because lots of people lost their remote controls and did n't know where it was , and it could be a handy place to keep it .
--------------------

and we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , yeah , maybe it would .
and how big should it be ?
the water is important .
{ vocalsound } ah i can see it now .
it 's just to get used to it .
just think about it .
or { disfmarker } there are buttons on it .
yes that one .
and { disfmarker } universal .
uh i also forgot my mouse , yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and do n't know where it is ,
--------------------
Ref:
when discussing the conceptual design of the remote control , the group noticed that the energy source was also a problem worth concern .
the industrial design proposed to make it rechargeable at first , but because of their limited budget , he had to change his idea .
the industrial design then put forward to setting a station at home or perhaps just using normal batteries to run the remote control , both of which would be feasible .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager introduced the button layout , the shape and the appearance of the remote control .
the buttons would be arranged in a triangle shape , with the on off button on the top and a gap at the bottom for the power button .
there would also be a number of buttons for volume , channel selection , mute , menu and channel flipping .
user interface designed a trendy and user-friendly interface that was both smaller and uniquer .
industrial designer designed universal buttons that could be used for different devices .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , it probably would be universal .
okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .
we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting .

okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
there are buttons on it .
maybe more trendy .
just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
we 're gon na make a remote control .
not just a tv .
folder , two .
maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , yeah , everything and { disfmarker } or { disfmarker } that you want on a { disfmarker } uh i i set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , it 's just to get used to it .
ah i can see it now .
because { gap } that 's .
and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , so we have to uh use a big market in europe .
the production cost are about half the price of selling price , and how big should it be ?
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface drew a draft for the group to get a more direct idea about the button layout .
through a brief discussion , they agreed that as long as they made the button clear enough to be recognized , it would not matter much where the exact button was .
the group also thought about a remote control which was able to be folded , in order to test if it would be strong enough to stand hit .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface suggested that the buttons on the remote control could be arranged in such a way that they were always at the same place , so that users could get used to seeing them whenever they needed them .
also , the on off button must be on top of the other buttons to make it universal and easy to find .
in this way , it would be easier for users to switch between different devices without confusing each other .
besides , there should be a lot of buttons for different kinds of devices , such as tv , mouse , etc .
--------------------
topk:
that you want on a { disfmarker } yeah , maybe it would .
yeah , it probably would be universal .
okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .
we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting .
the the second thing is the conceptual design , that 's what it that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
and we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market .
and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever .
okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
yeah , everything maybe more trendy .
there are buttons on it .
um for m for me uh the marketing expert , the user requirements uh specification , do i need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the { disfmarker } why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
yeah .
like this ?
two .
it 's just to get used to it .
so i { disfmarker } technical fun fu and now you can put it always at the same place .
mouse .
uh i also forgot my mouse , uh i i set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , ah i can see it now .
--------------------
Ref:
when discussing the button layout , the user interface drew a draft to show how to make the remote control more unique and attractive .
he suggested to put several essential and useful buttons together in the same place , and others might be scattered on the remote control , on all of which there would be clear logos .
as long as the button layout was user-friendly enough , the user interface thought it did not really matter much where the buttons would be .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the functional design of the remote control .
firstly , user interface designer introduced the technical function design for remote tv control , which was to have sophisticated functions while with an easy to use interface .
then , project manager presented the requirements for the component component design , including the chip , chip size , color , material , and chip type .
industrial designer then went on to give three presentations on the industrial design process and the components design .
after that , the group discussed how to relate the design to the budget .
finally , they discussed the role of secretary and program manager in this project .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
industrial designer , yeah .
component component , yeah .
that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
uh i i will focus on user interface design .
of the uh of real reaction okay , so .
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote tv control .
so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things .
yeah .
do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
twelve , nearly thirteen , wireless remote control .
design a wireless remote control .
{ vocalsound } so , i will open our functional design meeting .
so , i will play role of the secretary .
as also program ma manager .
so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and um yeah .
as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control .
fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
so my job is to uh design a google tv controller which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .
so { disfmarker } this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the industrial design .
uh with sophisticated functions , which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
--------------------
Ref:
this was a functional design meeting .
based on the presentations of the user interface designer , the industrial designer and the marketing expert , the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful , easy to use , fashionable , recognizable , only for television and internet-connected .
after discussing the industrial design of the product , the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller with less buttons but whether the product would be wireless was still unsolved .
as for the product appearance , the group decided to make the product look fancy and recognizable ; nevertheless , they had different opinions on the colour of the product .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager proposed to have a link between the remote control and the television , which would make it easier for users to find the tv .
industrial designer thought it would n't be too much of a cost-prohibitive project , and user interface designer agreed .
however , project manager reminded them that they had to take care of the product requirements in their thinking , so they decided to discard the teletext as it was something that 's no one else would care about .
after that , the team discussed the decision on the functions , including the secretary role , channel selection , mute button , power button and menu button .
--------------------
topk:
uh , i do n't think it will be too much .
yeah .
so .
industrial designer .
i think it would be simpler .
so , i had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .
so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we do n't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it 's something that 's { disfmarker } industrial design .
yeah .
do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
twelve , nearly thirteen , marketing expert .
so , i will play role of the secretary .
as also program ma manager .
so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and um yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
and also it has to be attractive , of course , which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
the manuals .
okay ?
so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .
so last slide .
um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .
i think it 's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
marketing experts .
{ vocalsound } and after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after .
mm so um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer .
--------------------
Ref:
based on the presentations of the user interface designer , the industrial designer and the marketing expert which were about the product requirements , the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful , easy to use , fashionable , recognizable and only for television .
furthermore , the remote control should use the internet rather than teletext due to the spread of the internet .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
both the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommended to design a wireless remote control with sophisticated functions , elegant , easy to use interface .
a very good example is google .
as we know google was a successful product because it had a powerful function , but with an easy-to-use interface , it was easy for users to lose it .
in addition , there were over twelve or twenty functions of a remote tv control , so how can they design an interface with so many functions ?
the team decided to merge the two systems .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
industrial designer .
but if we have very very good user interface industrial design .
design a wireless remote control .
{ vocalsound } so has to be yellow .
yeah .
just think of the problem .
if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the so it 's it 's interesting information , i think .
and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on .
so we should change this as well .
and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well .
and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
and uh this is one of the main point for me .
but i 'll come back to it later .
'kay .
could you go next slide ?
uh , so as you said uh , to merge the two system huh .
industrial designer , yeah .
component component , yeah .
uh i i will focus on user interface design .
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things .
so , i will play role of the secretary .
as also program ma manager .
so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and um um so move to the next slide .
as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
there 's a lot of functions .
over , i think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote tv control .
so how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
um , let 's move to next slide .
um .
yeah .
so i so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
a very good example is google .
as we know uh google it 's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .
um so move to next s slide .
wireless remote control .
marketing expert .
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
uh with sophisticated functions ,
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface designer recommended to design a google tv controller because google was very successful for its powerful functions and friendly user interface .
also , to make the customers able to use the product without learning the manual , the industrial designer suggested applying some international standards such as some pictograms .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought it would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , because now everybody has internet at home , so it 's better to use internet then teletext .
industrial designer agreed and suggested that they could connect to internet to surf the web .
user interface disagreed and pointed out that the internet connection was too great for email .
project manager insisted that it could be linked to the tv , which was accepted by all the team members and they agreed to do it .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , but this this mean that your tv would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
wireless remote control .
because if we want to to do remote control i think it would be simpler .
i think it 's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , too great for email then .
industrial design .
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
marketing expert .
no yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it 's better to use internet then teletext .
that might just so .
yeah .
so .
that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
okay , so .
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote tv control .
yeah but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the industrial designer .
--------------------
Ref:
the industrial designer expressed concern about how to connect tv to the internet and the user interface designer said a set box would enable tv to surf the internet .
however , the technology was not very popular , which might be an obstacle for global usage of the product .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer started the discussion about the industrial design of the remote control based on the average prices of components in the market and the budget .
the team agreed that the technology would cost around eight euros , which was reasonable for a high-end product .
they also agreed to use a combination of plastic and rubber as the material for the case , and to make it fancy and attractive .
besides , they wanted it to be powerful enough to resist scratches and fingerprints .
then , industrial designer proposed to design an industrial user interface to present things in a user-friendly way .
--------------------
topk:
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
industrial designer , yeah .
component component , yeah .
and also it has to be attractive , of course , look fancy .
industrial design .
so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um so { disfmarker } so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the i think it would be simpler .
well the avera the average prices i think that this technology will cost , i dunno , around eight euros , so .
or at least you know , the industrial designer .
marketing expert .
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
yeah , marketing experts .
{ vocalsound } wireless remote control .
that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
--------------------
Ref:
the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller because it was cheaper than a laser .
secondly , the industrial designer preferred a wireless remote control as it was easier to manage but the suggestion was doubted by the marketing and the project manager considering the cost and user requirements .
another thing was about the buttons .
the marketing advised having less buttons because only ten percent of the buttons were actually in use and people tended to zap a lot .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it should be wire wireless re remote con because it was easier to manage and because the battery problem could be solved .
project manager disagreed with industrial designer because he believed that it would increase the price of the remote control .
user interface argued that they could have both wireless and wire-free remote controls .
so the group decided to discuss it with the graphical user designer and the marketing expert before making a final decision about the design of wireless control in the next meeting.project manager also pointed out the problem of losing the link between the television and component component .
--------------------
topk:
design a wireless remote control .
{ vocalsound } yeah .
just think of the problem .
if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
industrial design .
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
industrial designer , yeah .
component component , yeah .
wireless remote control .
yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it 's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer , but you know .
if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question .
but if we have very very good user interface i think it 's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , so and the next slide , it is the last one it 's so it 's i think it should be wire wireless re remote con because you know , it 's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , i at my side prefer a wireless .
with a { disfmarker } so , baba is the uh the industrial designer .
okay .
marketing expert .
but mayb you 'd yes , you can .
it 's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it 's it 's a question that we can raise , so .
we can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire .
we can have both also .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the so it 's it 's interesting information , i think .
and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on .
so we should change this as well .
and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well .
and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
and uh this is one of the main point for me .
but i 'll come back to it later .
'kay .
could you go next slide ?
uh , so as you said uh , and to discuss it with uh the other members .
the wire ?
yeah , but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
--------------------
Ref:
firstly , the industrial designer said the wireless technology would cost 8 euros which was higher than the manager 's expectation .
secondly , whether the users would like to have a wireless control or not was unknown and the marketing would go to figure it out .
finally , having a link between the remote control and the television would prevent control from losing .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface designer recommended to design an elegant , easy to use interface .
a very good example is google .
as we know google was a successful because it had a powerful function , but with very few buttons , it would be difficult for the user to know what to do with all the buttons .
the solution is to have many colours of different colours instead of having one grey standard .
also , the remote control should be able to merge the two systems , which would make it more user-friendly .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
uh i i will focus on user interface design .
because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the marketing expert .
okay , so .
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote tv control .
but if we have very very good user interface to merge the two system huh .
for cheap remote control , yeah .
so it 's it 's interesting information , i think .
and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on .
so we should change this as well .
and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well .
and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
and uh this is one of the main point for me .
but i 'll come back to it later .
'kay .
could you go next slide ?
uh , so as you said uh , so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard { disfmarker } yeah , but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
so , i will play role of the secretary .
as also program ma manager .
so , we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and um this would definitely be a good way of selling more .
okay .
so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things .
um so move to the next slide .
as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
there 's a lot of functions .
over , i think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote tv control .
so how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
um , let 's move to next slide .
um .
yeah .
so i so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
a very good example is google .
as we know uh google it 's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .
um so move to next s slide .
industrial design .
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
--------------------
Ref:
the industrial designer recommended mixing several functions in one button by having a switch menu .
for example , the category the functions into several classes and link switch menu to this kind of this category of functions .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager suggested that the remote control should be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and the slogan .
industrial designer thought it would be better if the loo had a fancy look .
user interface designer agreed and proposed to design a user-friendly lcd screen .
marketing thought the look was bad for the budget , so the team decided to use a simple one-curved design .
project manager also suggested to add some other component that was in between the electrical and electronic device .
--------------------
topk:
and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
i think it would be simpler .
look fancy .
the look , how it look like .
yeah , the the look is is bad for them so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um and also it has to be attractive , of course , industrial design .
industrial designer .
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
yeah .
so .
marketing expert .
so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the but what i 'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .
but { disfmarker } you mean the loo the look , the outside ?
that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
--------------------
Ref:
based on earlier experiments and questionnaires , the marketing found that seventy-five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly .
thus , the group decided to make the product look fancy so that people would pay more .
however , how to make remote control look fancy was a big problem because different people have different opinions about fancy .
what 's more , the project manager thought the product should be recognizable and attractive .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the industrial designer thought it should be wire wireless re remote con because it was easier to manage and you know because the battery problem can be solved .
the user interface designer preferred a battery or a wire to connected you .
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but at the end of the day , it would depend on the customer 's preference .
project manager agreed and proposed to have the remote control which will be powerful and easy to use .
it has to be attractive , of course .
--------------------
topk:
but if we have very very good user interface look fancy .
yeah , it 's done , just yeah .
if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it .
industrial designer , yeah .
component component , yeah .
industrial design .
yeah , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .
and also it has to be attractive , of course , and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
so we can move to the next slide .
as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .
so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the so and the next slide , it is the last one it 's so it 's i think it should be wire wireless re remote con because you know , it 's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , i at my side prefer a wireless .
the look , how it look like .
so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .
to merge the two system huh .
industrial designer .
and we do n't really want the price to be too too high , because we wan na be able to produce it .
so , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it 's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
uh i i will focus on user interface design .
so it 's it 's interesting information , i think .
and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on .
so we should change this as well .
and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well .
and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
and uh this is one of the main point for me .
but i 'll come back to it later .
'kay .
could you go next slide ?
uh , so as you said uh , marketing expert .
so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful .
um so move to the next slide .
as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
there 's a lot of functions .
over , i think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote tv control .
so how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
um , let 's move to next slide .
um .
yeah .
so i so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
a very good example is google .
as we know uh google it 's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .
um so move to next s slide .
--------------------
Ref:
they thought in order to make the product look fancy , the product should have many colours instead of having one grey standard to meet different customers ' needs .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
project manager thought that the remote control should be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and the slogan , so that people would be able to recognize it when they saw it in a shop .
he also thought it had to be attractive , of course .
however , he admitted that it would increase the price of the production if it was too fancy .
industrial designer agreed with project manager on this point , pointing out that a fancy look is bad for the budget .
marketing agreed and suggested that they could make it look fancy to attract more customers .
--------------------
topk:
look fancy .
and also it has to be attractive , of course , and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .
the wire ?
so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um i think it would be simpler .
yeah , but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
that might just so .
marketing experts .
{ vocalsound } okay ?
so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .
so last slide .
um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .
yeah , the the look is is bad for them so , baba is the uh the industrial designer .
okay .
yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that .
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .
is it okay ?
um so move to the next slide .
as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
there 's a lot of functions .

um so move to next s slide .
the look , how it look like .
industrial design .
i mean that 's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it 's our product .
and we do n't really want the price to be too too high , because we wan na be able to produce it .
so , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it 's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .

--------------------
Ref:
the project manager agreed that the product should be good-looking but having many colours was n't a good idea because it would increase the product cost .
also , the project manager thought the remote control should be marked with the image of the society so that one can recognize it at a glance .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the detailed design of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced the agenda for the next meeting .
the group discussed the squishy fruitiness of their remote controls and how they might pursue that .
they also talked about materials they 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .
after that , marketing gave a presentation on the evaluation criteria for their product , which included the user requirements and the trends found in marketing reports and in the company strategy marketing .
then , industrial designer and user interface gave presentations on their prototype making process and leadership and teamwork .
--------------------
topk:
i 've got a presentation .
these obscure fruits .
and new ideas found ?
i think you were fine .
okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } and how was our leadership and teamwork ?
{ vocalsound } yeah , yeah .
the { disfmarker } so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
or i mean we could even have fruit like around { vocalsound } and it 's under evaluation .
two .
it 's called evaluation criteria .
i think it depends on the role they 're pretty cool .
um evaluation criteria .
um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?
like the the pens , the whiteboard , 'kay .
hmm .
okay everybody .
welcome to the detailed design meeting .
um let 's see .
our agenda .
last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .
um and i think looks like we 've come up with some ideas .
um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .
um so for later in the meeting i 've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we 'll take a look at that .
um and see if it 's changed at all from when we last discussed it .
um so actually i think yeah um f you guys wan na give a prototype presentation of { vocalsound } so we 'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
the prototype making was very creatively stimulating
--------------------
Ref:
project manager initiated the meeting topic on the detailed design .
specifically , the prototype presentation was given by industrial designer , and calculation on each evaluation criteria was led by marketing .
next , group members discussed changing aspects of the remote .
finally , they decided on changing the shape , instead of batteries .
then , project manager had a discussion on the process of the project with other teammates , including room for creativity , leadership , and convenience of materials .
the group decided to write a final report in the end .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer proposed to come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people would be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
project manager agreed and suggested that the shape of the strawberry shape should be just colour , and not necessarily the size of a strawberry .
user interface suggested a flat one , but industrial designer rejected it because it would have the battery inside it , which was against the company 's design .
--------------------
topk:
okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } the shape .
so .
um .
so it 's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .
so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
i did .
so we 'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
i think the wheel would probably be mm .
so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .
this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .
this is a mango .
we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .
but it would be coordinating with that of course .
one side is curved and then the other side is curved .
i think it depends on the role the flat one .
yeah .
'kay .
hmm .
okay everybody .
welcome to the detailed design meeting .
um let 's see .
our agenda .
last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .
um and i think looks like we 've come up with some ideas .
um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .
um so for later in the meeting i 've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we 'll take a look at that .
um and see if it 's changed at all from when we last discussed it .
um so actually i think yeah um f you guys wan na give a prototype presentation of { vocalsound } as if you 'd wanted to .
this one 's broccoli .
so like a f yeah , yeah .
yeah um like on a normal remote .
--------------------
Ref:
there were two main parts in the detailed design .
firstly , the prototype presentation , industrial designer presented the design on the wheel , the button , and the base of the remote control .
secondly , marketing presented eleven points to be evaluated based on the findings in marketing trend reports and company strategy marketing .
besides , the group had a point calculation on each evaluation criterion .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer proposed to come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people would be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
user interface suggested that they could change the shape of the buttons to make it more like a normal remote , but project manager thought it would annoy people if they got used to having buttons in one shape .
so they decided to keep the current shape and change to a flat one .
--------------------
topk:
it might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
the flat one .
yeah .
you could change the vegetable , or fruit .
okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } i did .
the { disfmarker } so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
so like a f so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .
this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .
this is a mango .
or like i dunno .
because { vocalsound } 'kay .
hmm .
okay everybody .
welcome to the detailed design meeting .
um let 's see .
our agenda .
last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .
um and i think looks like we 've come up with some ideas .
um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .
um so for later in the meeting i 've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we 'll take a look at that .
um and see if it 's changed at all from when we last discussed it .
um so actually i think yeah um f you guys wan na give a prototype presentation of { vocalsound } the shape .
so .
um .
is that the end ?
yeah um like on a normal remote .
i think it depends on the role so we 'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
these obscure fruits .
this one 's broccoli .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager suggested that the group might need to discuss changing an aspect of the remote .
according to the previous evaluation , the worst one was material .
thus , the group gave suggestions on the smallish size , smashed or resembled fruit shape , and printed patterns on rubber design .
the group also suggested changing batteries , but they ended up agreeing that there were no problems in battery design .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it was good because everyone got to contribute and everyone knew what they were doing .
project manager thought there was a lot of room for creativity in the design and teamwork .
user interface thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the team did a good job leading the discussion about the process of the project .
after that , marketing gave a presentation on the market research results and evaluation criteria for the product .
the findings were that the user requirements and trends found in marketing reports and in company strategy marketing were the same as those for technological innovation and ease of use .
--------------------
topk:
i think you were fine .
the prototype making was very creatively stimulating i think it was good .
we knew what we were doing .
it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
um did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of { disfmarker } and how was our leadership and teamwork ?
{ vocalsound } they 're pretty cool .
okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
but it would be coordinating with that of course .
i think it depends on the role the shape .
these obscure fruits .
a whole system , feels like play-dough .
because { vocalsound } the { disfmarker } and the beeper 's also inside there too somewhere and new ideas found ?
you did a good job leading .
and it 's under evaluation .
--------------------
Ref:
firstly , project manager asked about the room for creativity in fruit and squishiness .
user interface thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product has met all the criteria .
next , project manager reflected on his leadership and management role in the group .
other members gave recognition to his performance and everyone 's cooperation .
then , project manager asked about the convenience of the means for the materials and the pen used in the presentation .
group evaluated based on the user-friendly and the working efficiency .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group decided to change the shape of the remote control to a flat one .
project manager suggested that they could all be bananas and cucumbers , but user interface pointed out that it would be hard to do a strawberry still .
so the group agreed to keep the banana shape .
industrial designer then proposed to come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs on the rubber material , and people could buy three or five of them , because they would need to switch out their existing remotes .
--------------------
topk:
yeah .
that could work .
or i mean we could even have fruit like around { vocalsound } the shape .
yeah it 's sorta like a joystick .
yeah um like on a normal remote .
what if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .
so it 's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .
you could change the vegetable , or fruit .
okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .
so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
like you could probably do a strawberry still .
these obscure fruits .
right .
the flat one .
yeah .
'kay .
hmm .
okay everybody .
welcome to the detailed design meeting .
um let 's see .
our agenda .
last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .
um and i think looks like we 've come up with some ideas .
um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary .

um and see if it 's changed at all from when we last discussed it .
um so actually i think yeah um f you guys wan na give a prototype presentation of { vocalsound } yeah , yeah .
so we 'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they 'll need to switch 'em out .
or like i dunno .
our animals will forever be there .
--------------------
Ref:
instead of changing the shape of the remote , the group first discussed changing the batteries because some group mates gave a point under three .
however , marketing thought batteries were easy to insert so it would not be a problem anymore .
in addition , all the group members gave the shape of the remote only two points .
and they needed to change the most critical one .
the shape and the squishiness of the remote were an innovation in terms of technology .
therefore , they all agreed to change the shape .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it was good that everyone got to contribute to the process and everyone knew what they were doing .
project manager thought the leadership was crap personally .
user interface thought they did a good job leading the prototype making process , but the teamwork was lacking .
marketing thought there were too many spats among the team members , and they should have focused more on the shape of the remote control .
industrial designer agreed that they could have done a better job of coordinating with each other .
the group agreed to make a follow-up meeting .
--------------------
topk:
and how was our leadership and teamwork ?
{ vocalsound } i think you were fine .
well the thing is , like i actually worked in a company , the { disfmarker } okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .
um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .
and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down .
um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .
these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met .
we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .
and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .
and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .
i would like to show you the table we have to use .
um .
no .
this is the table .
can you see this here ?
i think it was good .
we knew what we were doing .
it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
they 're pretty cool .
but it would be coordinating with that of course .
if it 's somewhere in between you put four .
the shape .
yeah .
very democratic .
no spats , that was good .
well i thought my leadership was crap personally .
you did a good job leading .
these obscure fruits .
i did .
the prototype making was very creatively stimulating yeah , well i 'm never gon na do a management position , i know that now .
it asks about that .
so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .
this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .
this is a mango .
--------------------
Ref:
project manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position .
while industrial designer thought project manager did tell them when to start and when to end , which was important in good leadership .
and user interface thought project manager did a good job in leadership because they did n't have set roles so much , which was a democratic process .
marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group agreed that the materials they used were convenient and technologically innovative .
however , industrial designer pointed out that he was not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of the other presentation materials .
project manager disagreed and suggested that they could use the unix or the off market , sort of wordperfect and all these other things .
user interface agreed and thought they were obscure fruits and vegetables , so they should stick with bananas and cucumbers .
marketing thought it would be better if they put four fruits on the remote control .
--------------------
topk:
that was material .
so .
um .
slide show .
material technologically innovative , okay .
um , okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?
like the the pens , the whiteboard , so i need where 's the cable ?
right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
um .
right .
this does n't okay .

so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers .
--------------------
Ref:
both user interface and industrial designer thought it was not helpful to use powerpoint to present .
instead , they preferred writing notes for massive information , while marketing and project manager thought powerpoint materials were quite useful .
specifically , project manager mentioned that he felt ignorant when the group was explaining things .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
this meeting was mainly about the designing and evaluation of the remote control .
firstly , project manager introduced the prototype , which was a lemon tv with a pineapple shape and one button , scroll wheel with push button on it .
then , industrial designer , user interface and marketing each gave a presentation on the components of their remote controls , and the team got acquainted with each other through drawings and videos .
after that , they discussed the look and feel of each component , including the logo , colour , fashion in electronics , material , buttons , etc .
--------------------
topk:
so the case .
so let 's go for our detailed design meeting .
ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control .
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control so we 'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , so so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
we will have first to { disfmarker } and for the marketing guy ?
so this is a introduction of our product .
so one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it .
and our industrial designer , baba .
so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , and and very sophisticated material , so .
i prefer the laser remote control .
no .
vegetables .
mushroom is a vegetable .
we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , final prototype , right .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
the fruit ?
yeah .
do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
--------------------
Ref:
this was a meeting on the detailed design .
first , the user interface designer presented a prototype to show the basic colour and shape of the product .
next , the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it , so the group started to judge the design in three aspects : how fancy , technologically innovative , and easy-to-use the remote control was .
it got three , two , and four in separate aspects , which meant the design was acceptable .
later , the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget .
furthermore , they came up with some new ideas about future products , such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable tv that followed the trend and people 's moods .
finally , the group named the product as pineapple remote control .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the team agreed that the product should be made of two basic colours , yellow and red , with a basic shape .
the first shape was a circle and the second is a triangle .
in terms of the material , the team decided to use genetically modified mushroom because it looked more like a pineapple .
for the fancy look and feel , they would use a combination of rubber and very sophisticated material such as titanium and double curved plastic .
they also agreed on the colour black and yellow as it was the fashion trend at the time .
--------------------
topk:
fancy look and feel .
it looks more like a pineapple .
looks like more fruit .
maybe a pineapple ?
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , genetically modified mushroom i will say , but the mood of persons , the fashions uh { disfmarker } uh red it 's uh is more attractive .
so we used two basic colour , yellow and red .
and the shape , there 's two basic shape .
the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
double curved .
and and very sophisticated material , so .
double curve , yeah , double curve .
red and yellow .
black then is a regular colour , so .
yeah but it 's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d it looks like a { disfmarker } and our industrial designer , baba .
okay , we 'll see after .
maybe one of the { disfmarker } i think i would choose this one because of the colour .
it 's the the yellow ball thing that { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface designer put forward that the basic colour would be red and yellow and there would be two basic shapes - circle and triangle , which was called a mushroom design .
specifically , the prototype had 3 key features - a fuzzy look , a spherical channel selection and a stable triangle base .
however , the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends so the group decided to change it into a pineapple .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
user interface thought the basic colour should be yellow and red because it was more attractive .
there were two basic shapes , a circle and a triangle , and the shape was made up of two pieces .
the first was a pineapple shape , the second was double curved .
project manager thought it looked more like a lemon , so they did not need special colour .
for the marketing guy , it would be black and yellow .
industrial designer agreed with user interface on this point , pointing out that black is a regular colour , while yellow is more fashionable .
--------------------
topk:
yeah , red and yellow .
red and yellow .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
uh red it 's uh is more attractive .
so we used two basic colour , yellow and red .
and the shape , there 's two basic shape .
the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .
and for the marketing guy ?
yeah , so , do we need special colour ?
it looks more like a pineapple .
l_c_ display , maybe .
interface .
black then is a regular colour , so .
and our industrial designer , baba .
it would be bet more like a lemon ?
double curved .
i prefer the laser remote control .
no .
fancy look and feel .
so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , because i yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
product prod so i will still play the role of the secretary , and we 'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan ,
--------------------
Ref:
because yellow was their company colour and red was more attractive , which met the product requirement that the remote control should have a fancy look to attract the customers .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
marketing disagreed with the user interface designer on the shape of the product because he thought it was very boring .
he preferred a fancy look and feel , like a flying saucer .
the marketing believed that the remote control should not be too big or too small , and it should be coarse to fine design .
in addition , he pointed out that it would be hard for the customers to distinguish the fruit shape from the other shapes in the market , such as red and yellow , so he suggested making it double curved .
--------------------
topk:
fancy look and feel .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
yeah , it looks more like a pineapple .
it would be bet more like a lemon ?
or it would be better .
one thing i like is the shape , because you know it 's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket .
double curved .
i prefer the laser remote control .
no .
because i yeah the shape is very boring .
so the shape now .
product prod so it 's coarse to fine design .
and our industrial designer , baba .
i think i would choose this one because of the colour .
it 's so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , i would say flying saucer .
red and yellow .
the fruit ?
yeah .
--------------------
Ref:
in the user interface designer 's design , the shape of the product and the buttons were all mushrooms , but the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends because mushroom was neither a vegetable nor a fruit .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer thought it was funny and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end .
looking at the chips , the solar cells and the logic board was very informative for the team .
project manager preferred the laser remote control because it would be technologically innova innovative and easy to use .
user interface preferred fancy look and feel .
marketing thought the scroll wheel was cool and sophisticated material .
industrial designer agreed and suggested the colour yellow and red .
after that , they discussed the material of the buttons and decided to have one button for each color .
--------------------
topk:
okay , we 'll see after .
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and for the marketing guy ?
so we 'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and our industrial designer , baba .
product prod i prefer the laser remote control .
no .
yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .
{ vocalsound } yeah , the pr at { disfmarker } the fruit ?
yeah .
fancy look and feel .
nine over three .
so one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
yeah .
yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .
i think i would choose this one because of the colour .
it 's and and very sophisticated material , so .
yeah , i think i find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
and designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .
i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
maybe one of the { disfmarker }
--------------------
Ref:
the marketing suggested measuring how good the design was instead of just talking about it so the group started to judge the design in three aspects on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being false .
the criterion was how fancy , technologically innovative , and easy-to-use the remote control was and it got three , two , and four in separate aspects , which meant it was acceptable .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the group thought the remote control was technologically innovative because it had only one button , which was easy to use and powerful .
there was also technology inside that could recognise simple vocal comments , so it would be easy for users to find it even if it was lost .
besides , there were two kinds of balls , a lemon and a pineapple , both of which were fashionable in electronics at the time .
the group agreed that the design was fancy look and feel , sophisticated material and tactile buttons were also innovative .
--------------------
topk:
so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , is it easy to use ?
{ vocalsound } yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .
{ vocalsound } and you have the there 's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?
there four microphone .
we have tactile buttons .
as we have voice recognition , i think .
and our industrial designer , baba .
there 's two kind of balls , fruits and vegetables .
and and very sophisticated material , so .
so it 's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
fancy look and feel .
the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
mush mushroom controller .
yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really { disfmarker } because i that 's good .
ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control .
--------------------
Ref:
the controller had an embedded microphone array which could recognise simple vocal commands and the four microphones could capture voice from different directions .
it also had tactile buttons , which was a really good point .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
the marketing and the industrial designer agreed that the controller was easy to use , but the user interface designer thought it was not powerful enough .
the project manager thought that it would be interesting to see if people would buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after seeing if they got positive feedback from customers .
in the end , they decided to have something yellow and red for the costs , with a fancy look and feel , double curved buttons and very sophisticated material , so it could be quite convenient for users .
--------------------
topk:
fancy look and feel .
and for the marketing guy ?
so it 's quite convenient for user to use it .
because i i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
and our industrial designer , baba .
the fruit ?
yeah .
in the basement .
in the basement .
yeah , the pr at { disfmarker } you can use this in this way .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
oh no , interface .
yeah , especially on the easy to use double curved .
vegetables .
mushroom is a vegetable .
or it would be better .
so i will still play the role of the secretary , and we 'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
so it 's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
and and very sophisticated material , so .
--------------------
Ref:
the user interface designer thought it was easier than a traditional controller because you did n't have to press a button , just turn the ball to a certain angle to select channels .
however , the marketing and the industrial designer thought it was quite difficult because users did n't know the angle was the correct one and they had to go through all the channels if they wanted to jump from channel one to twenty .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer and project manager gave a presentation on the prototype of the remote control based on a questionnaire they had received from the user interface designer .
the team agreed that it was a good design with fancy look and feel , good functionality and sophisticated material .
they also decided to add some features to it after discussion , such as voice recognition and four microphone arrays .
then , they discussed the price of fruits and vegetables , yellow and red for the costs within the budget of twelve fifty euros , and pineapple for twenty-five euros .
--------------------
topk:
and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .
{ vocalsound } and our industrial designer , baba .
and and very sophisticated material , so .
okay , we 'll see after .
as we have voice recognition , i think .
so the case .
it 's good they 're not charging anything for that .
{ vocalsound } i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
fruits and vegetables .
yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
and for the marketing guy ?
no , it 's not so expensive .
yeah .
yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .
fancy look and feel .
yeah , the pr at { disfmarker } i think i would choose this one because of the colour .
it 's yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
so i think the costs are within the budget .
we 're just at twelve fifty euros .
there four microphone .
yeah , yeah yeah .
that 's
--------------------
Ref:
the group decided that the product would have a low level chip , one button with lcd , a scroll wheel with a push button on it , a battery in the base , a single curve , and solar cells and it would be plastic instead of wooden so that the costs were 12.5 euros which was within the budget .
furthermore , they came up with some new ideas about future products , such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable tv that followed the trend and people 's moods .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
when discussing the production cost of the remote control , the group decided to keep the solar cells because it would be too expensive to replace them with a battery .
however , project manager pointed out that the cost could be reduced by adding a genetically modified mushroom , which was not feasible in the current market , so they decided not to do that at first .
industrial designer then proposed to add a double curve , but user interface objected and suggested that they could use a single curve instead .
after all , it was cheaper and more environmentally friendly .
--------------------
topk:
the solar cell is too expensive .
{ vocalsound } but we have solar cells .
solar cells .
yeah , and also you can , if you i and our industrial designer , baba .
maybe do n't bat no battery , only solar cells .
so we need to calculate the production cost .
as i said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty euros .
product prod so we have to { disfmarker } yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
in the basement .
in the basement .
double curve , yeah , double curve .
we will have first to { disfmarker } and for the marketing guy ?
i think i would choose this one because of the colour .
it 's or it would be better .
genetically modified mushroom i will say , but yeah .
yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .
single curve .
--------------------
Ref:
although solar cell was the most expensive part of the whole product , it still played a crucial role in making the controller technologically innovative .
plus , it would be interesting for their marketing team to make a lot of advertisements to sell it .
--------------------

==================================================
Pred:
industrial designer disagreed with the marketing because he thought that it would be interesting for their marketing team to make a lot of advertisements concerning solar cells to be prominently displayed on the remote control , but he did not think it was necessary for the product to have a fancy look and feel .
he believed that they should stick to the easy to use and powerful design and very sophisticated material , which is what they already have in their current product , such as the lcd screen and the fruits and vegetables cover .
--------------------
topk:
in the base .
and for the marketing guy ?
and our industrial designer , baba .
yeah , with mi fancy look and feel .
fruits and vegetables .
close to .
and and very sophisticated material , so .
because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
target .
and new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow .
{ vocalsound } or it would be better .
oh , that 's interesting .
you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things .
electronic device .
because i uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
i think , yeah .
but it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be { disfmarker } i think you can if you have a scale , so { disfmarker } yeah , especially on the easy to use so it 's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
--------------------
Ref:
the marketing thought they should not trust too much the trend because it would n't last long - fruits and vegetables were in fashion this year but maybe next year it would be insects .
however , the industrial designer believed it was good to follow the flow now and then since electronic devices were not long life products : if people changed , the product appearance should change as well .
