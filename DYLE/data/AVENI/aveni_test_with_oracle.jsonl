So let me just make sure I've done this correctly for you. Um, so because I'm kind of speaking to you for the first time, I am gonna go through the terms of business again with you. Apologies if you've been through this with your previous advisor. I just think it's really important just to kinda update your, my role, what services that we provide that ACME Limited provides, and also to decide whether we're providing focused advice at today's meeting or whether we're gonna be looking at the fuel holistic approach for you as well.

Yeah, I can see it.", "line": 6}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Great. Um, so, so my role, so I'm an advisor representing ACME Limited, like your previous advisor. We offer restricted advice on investments, pensions, and protection solutions from a limited number of providers that ACME Limited has carefully selected. Okay. Now, restricted doesn't mean that my advice is restricted. I can still provide holistic advice. It just means that I would only recommend products and services that we've carefully selected. Okay. Now, there's another type of advisor that you can speak to, which is often referred to as an independent whole of market. They tend to be self-employed, you know, they can give you advice technically across the whole of market, but you tend to find nowadays, Mr. Smith, that independent advisors are few and far between. It's very difficult to actually demonstrate that you're gonna be giving advice across the whole of market because, you know, you can imagine how many products and services are out there. Um, so I'm known, uh, as what is called a restricted advisor. So you'll be pleased to know, Mr. Smith, that all of your personal information held back ME Limited will be kept safe and secure. No personal information about you will ever be sold. Um, now to manage better your relationship with us, we will of course only share your data within our group and with companies that provide services to you or to us.

Is that okay?", "line": 9}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yep. Yeah, I'm fine with that.", "line": 10}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Again, just to, just to give you some reassurance, we would only ever store personal sense of information if it was relevant to any advice that I'm providing.

Although I can see you, um, this is the first time I'm speaking to you.

Yeah.", "line": 14}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Thank you.

Thank you. Now I've seen you hopefully I won't have to ask you those questions again in the future. Okay. So today's meeting, I'm going to be obviously gaining understanding of your current financial position. Um, I have pretty much completed fact find from your last meeting with your previous advisor, but I think it would still be prudent to go through your assets one more time. Just make sure that all the information we hold is still rela relative, uh, and correct.", "line": 19}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay.", "line": 20}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "And then I just want to fully understand kind of what your goals and aspirations are, um, for now and for the future. Um, and to help me do that, what we're gonna be doing is completing what I would call a life plan, which we'll really focus in on your home, your occupation, your family, and your lifestyle, and what are your plans for each area over the medium to long term. Okay? Uh, and based on your aspirations for the future, we can then discuss how these will be achieved. Okay. Um, and we can open up the discussion, discuss any other matters that perhaps you may not have thought about. And then based on that, we'll agree on the next steps.", "line": 21}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Alright? Yeah, that, that sounds good.", "line": 22}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Thank you. So just to go through our services charter and charges with you, uh, if I can just find the right form, here it is. Okay. So there's two types of service that we offer, uh, can be limited. Okay? We have, uh, one off advice service, and then we have an ongoing advice review service. So the one-off advice service, Mr. Smith, this is what you would've gone through when you initially set up your personal discretionary portfolio with us. Um, can you remember going through that all?", "line": 23}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yes. Yeah, I mean, definitely yes. Yeah.", "line": 24}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, good. So at the time, you'd have opted for the ongoing advice review service, um, and as part of that ongoing advice review service, that means that we have an obligation to meet with you once a year to complete a full financial review meeting, which is firstly obviously to assess the suitability and the performance of your current portfolio. Um, but probably more importantly, it's also to look at other wider holistic financial planning need areas depending on your life and your circumstances that may have changed since our last meeting. Okay. So today's meeting will complete a full holistic review because it's the first time that I'm meeting you. Um, and if I feel that I can add value or provide any advice on other needed areas, the aim for me would be, you know, to kind of book a second or third meeting where I would then present my recommendations to you.", "line": 25}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Uh, and, and based on that, you can decide whether you want to implement those changes or not. Um, that's, that's wholly up to you. Now, ongoing advice, currently ongoing advice is five basis points, 0.5% per annum. It's taken monthly in arrears from your products. You're not gonna face a bill at the end of each year. Um, but that ongoing advice review covers the cost of today's meeting. And it means that if you wanted to invest new money either into your portfolio or into a new on-platform product, we will not charge you the one-off advice fee, which is 1.5%, which you have paid when you first established your portfolio.", "line": 26}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "That's right. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. Okay,", "line": 27}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Fantastic. Now, the only time I would charge a one-off advice fee is if I was recommending a product that doesn't fit on our platform. For example, if I recommended that we set up a, a trust, which we regard as specialist advice, or if I recommended a protection policy, again, we don't charge a one-off advice fee, but commission may be payable, that's not commission personally payable to me, it would simply be the company we recommend would pay ACME Limited Commission for providing that business. Okay. Just so you know, I just wanna be completely transparent with you.", "line": 28}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay? Yeah, no, that's, that's perfect. Good to know. Thank you.", "line": 29}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Great. Now, the good news is that there's no financial report for the agreement to sign at today's meeting, uh, because again, you're paying for ongoing advice. Um, now you've been sent copies of these documents, so I'm not gonna go through every single paragraph, but again, I would recommend that you read these after this meeting. Um, couple of important points just to, just to point out, is that we are of course, regulated by the financial Conduct authority, the F C A, uh, they make sure that we are competent and qualified to provide advice to you, and that you are classed as a retail client and you are awarded the highest protection possible. So, um, if you ever want to make a complaint, hopefully you never do, but if you do, again, you can always come back to me personally. Uh, we do handle all of our complaints in the house. So rest assured that if you ever sent in a complaint or expressed the complaint to me, we would deal with this in-house and find the right solution for you as quickly as possible. Okay?", "line": 30}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay. Yeah, makes sense.", "line": 31}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "You'll be pleased to know I'm almost through the formalities now. Um, so last couple of points really. Um, now, although we're not a bank, we are covered under the financial services compensation scheme. What that means in practice is that your investments are protected up to 85,000 pounds, which mirrors a bank deposit for you. Okay. So with regards to our services and solution, um, okay, so this just shows you, uh, that the advice I can provide under my restricted license so I can provide advice on your protection needs, retirement solutions, investment solutions, and estate planning, everything we discussed earlier in the meeting. Uh, we do also have specialist advisors within the team that can provide retirement structuring as well. So that's when you kind of reach the point where you're looking to start generating an income from your pension or other parts of money. Um, you know, thankfully we're not there today. So really what we're gonna be focusing on is accumulating your wealth. Um, so, you know, looking at how different investment products could help you achieve your goals, thinking it's definitely worthwhile having a conversation, um, if we can, about your protection needs, which really underpins your long-term financial plans. Um, and we can discuss estate planning. So again, potentially looking at whether there's, uh, an inherent tax liability and whether that's something we need to address now or in the future.", "line": 32}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay, cool. Sure, that sounds good.", "line": 33}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Good stuff. Um, so the last document, terms and conditions, to be honest, this really just covers data protection, our commitment to you, your commitment to us who regulates us, you know, we're regulated by the financial services compensation scheme and their custodian. I'm not gonna go through this document today, I don't want to bore you. You'll be pleased to know. Um, but again, I would always recommend that you take some time just to read it after this meeting. And if you have any questions, please just come back to me personally.", "line": 34}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay.", "line": 35}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okey-doke. So I think I've covered off the formalities of the meeting. So let's dive into the main agenda. So I guess what I would first like to establish are your reasons for seeking advice. Why ACME Limited? Why now?", "line": 36}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Well, as a tricky one, um, really the main reason I'm seeking advice is because I'm not an expert when it comes to financial planning. I understand the basics of general and ISA products, but when it comes to pensions, I'm pretty clueless. I've got a large workplace pension, and I want to make sure that I'll have enough money when I come to retirement. Um, in terms of the question of why ACME Limited, I was referred by my friend Carol. She's been with ACME for years and couldn't speak highly enough of you, um, as a, as a business. So I thought I should give it a go.", "line": 37}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Brilliant. Good to know. Yeah, I I do know Carol. She's, she's a lovely lady. Um, great. No, that's great. It's all, it's all about establishing your, uh, your motivation, so that's really good to know. Right. Well, let us now jump into the, into the fact find, and that's really where we take all of your data about your current circumstances, just gain a good understanding of your current situation. So just before we jump into your assets, um, I just want to get to know you a bit better, Mr. Smith. So you, you mentioned your colleagues, I'm assuming you're, you're still working on a full-time basis?", "line": 38}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yes. Yeah, I've been with my company a long time now, uh, about 20 years.", "line": 39}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Well, they must be doing selling right? To keep you there for so long.", "line": 40}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Well, I'm a I'm a senior lab technician now, so I've worked my way up the ranks, um, started out as an intern.", "line": 41}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Wow.", "line": 42}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Um, and, and yeah, I mean, I love the work. I, I do, you know, um, I've been with them ever since I left university, to be honest.", "line": 43}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, brilliant. And what is the name of the company that you work for?", "line": 44}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "It's called Bugs and Co. Um, my job is very much on the research side. It's all to do with cancer research. Um, it, it's very satisfying when something works and as you know, it's, it's constant challenge. But I do enjoy what I do.", "line": 45}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Amazing. That's amazing work. Yeah. Do, do you kinda get personally involved in trying to get new treatments and, and drugs onto the market?", "line": 46}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, very much so. Um, my role is very much helping to develop the products and then helping exact, um, exactly as you've said, is to get them into the market. So, um, yeah, you, you know, the research side as you know, is just, um, it's still, it's still a long way off, but every day is a new day and, and there's hope and they're always, you know, there's always hope there.", "line": 47}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Amazing, amazing work. And again, 28 years service. That is, um, that is some longevity. Um, and again, we will talk about your plans going forward towards the back end of this meeting. Um, and you're, you're currently single, Mr. Smith, you don't have any financial dependence?", "line": 48}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No dependence. Um, I am, I am single, unfortunately, still waiting to meet the woman of my dreams.", "line": 49}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Uh, being single has its pros though, doesn't it? You're free to do what you want.", "line": 50}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, yeah. No, definitely, definitely. I love my, I love my life. Very busy one as well. Um, I actually can't think of, you know, how I'd, how I'd adapt myself to somebody else, you know, Bri bringing someone else in. So, no, I, I'm, I'm very, I'm completely happy. I'm very happy.", "line": 51}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, kids. Well, I'll be interested to, interested to see how you feel your, about your spare time when we talk about your lifestyle and you know, what your kinda hobbies and interests are. Um, but health wise, would you still, you know, cast yourself as being in excellent health?", "line": 52}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, fortunately, I'm, I'm, I keep myself fit and well try to keep myself fit and healthy, you know, go to the gym and, and stuff like that, so, yeah. Yeah.", "line": 53}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Great. And I've got it here that you don't smoke either, is that still correct?", "line": 54}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yep, that's correct.", "line": 55}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Non-smoking. Okay. Brilliant. Thank you. Okay, well let us look at your current asset position. Um, and as I said, I, I've got mainly all the details here, but please let me know if I've missed anything. Um, so I can see that you're currently owned your, uh, main residence with no mortgage, which is amazing.", "line": 56}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, yeah. Uh, I've been, um, I've been very lucky, to be honest. Um, obviously not that lucky. I, I've lost relatives, um, because, uh, but, but that means I've inherited money, uh, and the property at quite an early age, to be honest. So, which hasn't really given me, uh, it's really given me that boost into the market. So hence a lot of my assets are due to me being able to have no mortgage at this age, um, which I absolutely understand. I'm very, very fortunate to be in that position.", "line": 57}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no, absolutely. And, and the current value, would you state it's still worth around 400,000?", "line": 58}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, I would say so. I think that's a fair price.", "line": 59}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. And I've got it here that you've still got your second property as well, which I believe is rented out and provides some level of additional income to you.", "line": 60}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yes, so I inherited that property from my late father.", "line": 61}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Now I'm sorry to hear that. How long ago did your father pass away?", "line": 62}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Oh, God, uh, oh, 10 years ago. Um, and my mom went about 13 years ago, so, um, you know, I inherited both. I mean, they left me, I was there sole beneficiary, and obviously I, I've benefited from everything that they had.", "line": 63}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "So, no, no siblings either?", "line": 64}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, just me on my own.", "line": 65}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Um, and you've got an onshore bond with Standard Life sitting at 40,000 pounds. Do you take any withdrawals from the bond?", "line": 66}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, that's been invested since 2008.", "line": 67}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, good. Um, and then you've got the investment that, that we manage. Uh, I know recently you completed your ongoing advice review with the previous advisor before we moved on, so I'm not gonna spend any time today kind of repeating that process for you, but just to give you your updated balances, there is 425,000 pounds in your GIA, uh, and then there's 110,000 pounds in your ISA. So you can clearly see by moving monies from the GIA into the ISA each year, um, it's gonna make that a little bit more tax for you. So just let me touch upon the investment. Um, what do you, what do you see that money for that we're managing for you?", "line": 68}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Um, well, really it's for my future. I mean, and, and when I say my future, I mean, when I stop working, um, as I've just said, like I've never been an expert on pensions. I've got nice pensions built up, so really that is the pot for my retire, for my retirement. So I need to fall back on that for income or anything like that. Then that's there. So really it's, it's for my future, my financial security, if you, um, like my little war chest sort of thing.", "line": 69}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Would you say, you know, future plans for retirement are really important to you?", "line": 70}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Oh, for sure. Um, because I wanna make sure, you know, that I can still do the things that, you know, uh, I, I don't wanna have no income when I retire or not be able to do the things I want. So yes, it's, it's really important.", "line": 71}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "And would you say, and what would you say really are the sorts of activities, the lifestyle that you'd like to lead in retirement?", "line": 72}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'm a huge, huge fan of traveling. I've been lucky enough to travel, um, to Africa, south America, the far east, but there's always more places I'd like to visit. Um, I'd like to think that I had enough money when I retire to keep traveling. Health permitting.", "line": 73}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, absolutely. Wouldn't, wouldn't we all. Um, and obviously the portfolio naturally produces income, uh, that income is reinvested for you at the moment. Still happy with that, Mr. Smith?", "line": 74}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, I don't need any more income at the moment. I just want the funds to keep Greg.", "line": 75}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Oh, okay. Perfect. Thank you. Um, so, so there's your asset. So I've got that your total estate is worth about 1.7 million.", "line": 76}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Whoa. That's, um, that's incredible. When you see it on paper, it looks amazing, doesn't it? I know, I don't, I don't consider myself a millionaire.", "line": 77}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, it's, it's always, it's always funny when you, when you put it down on paper, just having it kinda laid out, you know, it's a nice exercise to, to go through. It clearly just shows obviously what's, what's liquid, what's tied up, what's there to be spent. It's just, yeah, it's always a beneficial exercise to, to go through, especially when you come out as being a millionaire. Um, so I guess with regards to your, uh, we've obviously gone through your, your balance sheet with regards to your expenditure. Um, I can see that your monthly bills come to around 600 pounds. You've got things like your car, transport costs, uh, general food, drinks, housekeeping, holidays, entertainment, and then other expenditure, which, you know, based on what you've got coming in, you've got a decent amount of surplus income. Would you say that's reflected in your current account at the moment?", "line": 78}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, there'll be month to month fluctuations, but all in all, I'd say so.", "line": 79}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. And I can see that you've also made a will back in 2008, and the notes that, uh, the notes that have kindly been left to me is that your estate is first of all left to your cousin, Billy, uh, yep. And Mary, 25% each. Um, and then you've got a God daughter Serena, uh, as well. Is that, is that right?", "line": 80}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yep, she's my best friend's daughter. Um, best friend Nikki and Serena's been my goddaughter. Um, so, so Apple my eye.", "line": 81}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "And how old is Serena now?", "line": 82}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Well, she's at uni at the moment. She's studying to become a vet, so she's done really, really well. I'm, I'm super proud of her.", "line": 83}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, I can, I can tell immediately by the way that you, that you speak about her, that you know, that's someone who's very close.", "line": 84}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Well, I think, you know, I've watched her grow up and, um, as I say, I'm her godfather and her mom's my best friend, so she's, she's a big part of, of our lives. Of my life.", "line": 85}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no, absolutely. Uh, and I okay that you've got the 25% to go into charity as well. Is that for tax reasons or purely because you have like a, a close connection that particular charity?", "line": 86}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, it's mainly, um, it's the cancer charities because obviously with work I do, I've lost friends to cancer, um, and I lost my mum to cancer. So, you know, I understand, uh, how important the money is to these, these research companies. Cuz without the money we can't do our research. So it's for those reasons really.", "line": 87}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no, absolutely. That, that's completely understandable. Um, and I think that that will, everything that we've just talked about is still applicable. You haven't made any amendments to it?", "line": 88}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, I still want my estate to be distributed in that way.", "line": 89}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Okay, good. Now I've also recommended that we complete a risk assessment at today's meeting, only because from what I can see on your record, it's now been five years, um, since we lost, completed a risk assessment and we understand, you know, attitudes to risk and change, um, as well as somebody's capacity for loss. You know, your, your capacity for loss now might be higher than it was five years ago, so it's not specifically to make any changes to your existing portfolio, but if we were to recommend a new investment or a new product, today's meeting, it can help us just have a good conversation about what sort of risk approach you may want to take with this new investment vehicle. Does that sound okay?", "line": 90}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, no, that, that sounds perfect.", "line": 91}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, great. So the questions haven't changed, so hopefully it all comes flooding back to you, Mr. Smith. Um, so just to remind you, try to get your investment portfolio out of your head. Okay. And just try to think about how you personally feel at this moment in time between risk and reward. Okay. So question one, how would you describe your typical attitude, uh, and making important financial decisions? Would you say you're very adventurous, fairly adventurous, balance of adventure and caution? Fairly careful or very careful?", "line": 92}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'd say I'm fairly adventurous.", "line": 93}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. When considering a major financial decision, which statement best describes the way you think about the possible losses or gains to get excited or optimistic? Do you accept that gains and losses are both possible or are you conscious or are you worried about the possible losses?", "line": 94}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'd say I'm still optimistic. Yeah, don't, don't get excited, but I'm optimistic cuz I always think, yeah, things, things will, things will come good in the end.", "line": 95}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Good, good way to view life really. Um, and how would you rate your own willingness to take financial risks? A very low risk taker, a low risk taker, moderate high, or very high risk taker?", "line": 96}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I, okay, I think I'm gonna play it safe and go in the middle, moderate risk taker.", "line": 97}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. And if you held a share-based investment, which technically you do and you heard bad financial news, would you worry about it? Do you strongly agree, tend to agree, tend to disagree or strongly disagree with this statement?", "line": 98}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'd say I tend to disagree because I understand it's long-term. It's for the long term I tend to to disagree.", "line": 99}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. And if you're watching Sky News and suddenly they said the Fusi is down by 10 basis points, you're not suddenly picking up the phone, you know, worrying about your investment", "line": 100}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "<laugh>? No, no, definitely not. No.", "line": 101}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Great. Uh, and question five, would you enjoy exploring new and different investment opportunities? Do you strongly agree, tend to disagree, tend to agree or strongly disagree?", "line": 102}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I tend to agree.", "line": 103}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Question six. If you had any money invested in shares, would you be nervous about the stock market following in the short term? Do you strongly agree, tend to agree, tend to disagree or strongly disagree?", "line": 104}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Um, I, no, I think, uh, this is a tend to disagree. It's like the other question really, isn't it?", "line": 105}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, yeah. It's just the kind of flip sided that. Question seven, if you have spare funds to invest, would you choose a risky investment for the excitement of seeing how it perform? Would you say that's very likely, possibly unlikely or very unlikely?", "line": 106}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Uh, well possibly let's, let's say possibly unlikely.", "line": 107}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Question eight. How do you think a close re friend or relative would describe your attitude to taking financial risks? Would they say that you're a very daring person? Would they say you're daring? Do you balance risk and caution or are you careful or are you very careful about taking risks?", "line": 108}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'd say I'm thinking about my best friend. Um, she would say I'm balancing risk and caution. Yeah, balancing risk and caution.", "line": 109}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. So final question. Imagine that you have some money in a low interest savings account, which would you want to invest in? And you have the choice of two investment products, which option are you most likely to choose? So the first option is a return slightly above a savings account, but with a small risk of losing some of your initial investment. The next option, Mr. Smith, is the option of a higher long-term return, but some r risk of losing a substantial portion of your investment. Um, or the last option is, would you put some money in each product? So really it's asking would you go low risk, would you go high risk or would you tend to spread,", "line": 110}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I think 10 to spread some in each.", "line": 111}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Perfect. So you'll be pleased to know that is the risk questionnaire completed. So thank you for your patience with that Mr. Smith. So as you can see here, uh, you're coming out as a medium high risk taker. So straight away that that's pleasing for me, uh, because you didn't answer any of the questions as the most cautious response, which could indicate that keeping money in cash would be the right thing for you. But clearly you've indicated that you accept that investments go up and down in value, you're very much focused on the long term, you know, you've got an appetite for risk. Okay. Um, so just to remind you, so at ACME Limited, we have a risk profile system of of one to six, which hopefully you can see on the screen here. So risk category one is very low risk and risk category six is very high risk.", "line": 112}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "So first of all, we don't give advice on, uh, risk category six investments. That would be kind of like, you know, more highly volatile asset classes, speculative investments, or going into direct stock or shareholding. So if you did want a very high risk investment, you know, we wouldn't be the best place for you to invest in and you'd probably be sophisticated enough to be in choosing your own investments anyway. So what we're looking at really is the, uh, the one to five range. Okay, so you came out as a medium to high risk, which we class as a risk category four. Um, so I'm just gonna read you the paragraph, um, for medium to high risk investment, okay? And then I'm gonna read the one above and the one below, and please just be honest and tell me whether you think you agree, uh, or whether you disagree and perhaps you would clash yourself as a high risk or a medium risk investor.", "line": 113}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay? Okay.", "line": 114}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "So risk category four s are choosing these investments which will mean you risk loss of capital, but you have the potential for a relatively good capital growth over the medium to long term. There are no guarantees and you can expect fluctuations in the capital value, whereas risk category five, these investments carry a high risk of capital loss, but have the potential to deliver high growth over the medium to long term. You should be prepared for your capital value to fluctuate significantly. Um, and they do not offer any guarantees. And then the one below, so risk category three, medium risk, there is a risk that you will lose some capital value if you choose this portfolio. Um, but you do have the potential for capital growth over the medium to long term. These investments typically come without any guarantees, and again, they're gonna fluctuate capital value. Okay? So what's similar with all the risk profiles as you can see, is that they all carry capital risk. Okay? So with any investments, you know, if you're moving your money outta cash and you're going to other asset classes, you will tend to see that your value will fluctuate. Um, and I'm assuming correctly that you're quite experienced with that because of your portfolio?", "line": 115}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, yeah, I've held my portfolio for a while now. Um, I understand the nature of, you know, uh, that it goes up and down and yeah, I've, I've remained at this level because, well, I think five is too high for me, but three I think is, uh, and young enough, you know, uh, sort of still stay up for, for two. Perhaps as I get closer, you know, into my fifties, I might want to think about reducing risk, but for now I want to benefit from any sort of, you know, um, capital growth by having, you know, more exposure to things which are equity based. And, um, I think I understand that from, you know, holding my, I I understand that from holding my current portfolio.", "line": 116}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, absolutely. Because ti time is on your side when it comes to your investment horizon, you feel that you continue to take a mutual high risk approach because that will outweigh any potential short-term market fluctuations with long-term capital growth.", "line": 117}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "That's it. Yeah, that, that sounds like a good summary of, of what I was trying to say,", "line": 118}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "<laugh>. Okay, good. Well thanks very much for that. So let, so lemme just make sure that this is saved for you. Okay, good. So we'll agree that you consider yourself to be a medium high risk taker. So your risk profile score is, is 31, probably won't me mean much to you, but it just helps us kind of determine where you fit on a risk profile. And I was assessed today, so we've read and understood your risk profile description and because of the amount of time you've held an investment with us, um, now Mr. Smith, I would class you as an experienced investor. That doesn't mean I'm expecting you to start picking and choosing your own funds or stock, so don't worry, it just means that you've already experienced market volatility and uh, you know, from from how you're speaking, it's clear that you understand that obviously market and asset values will go down and they will go up.", "line": 119}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay, good.", "line": 120}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Thank you. So I'm, I'm building up a nice picture of where you sit financially. Um, now with, with regard to any kind of immediate changes, is there anything happening within the next kind of six months that I need to be aware of?", "line": 121}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, nothing in the plan.", "line": 122}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Good. And are there likely to be any changes in your personal circumstances in the future, um, that I should be aware of that may affect the advice that I'm providing you with today?", "line": 123}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Again, no, no, not expecting any massive changes at all.", "line": 124}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Great. And, uh, long-term care, something I guess we all need to be mindful of in the future, um, it is not something I specifically want to discuss with you today, uh, mainly because you're, you know, you're 43 years old, you've still got, you know, many, many years ahead of you, hopefully. Um, so hopefully you may or may not need long-term care. Do you agree with that Mr. Smith, or is that something that you wanted to have a conversation with me about?", "line": 125}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, I'm gonna try and concentrate on, on living rather than thinking about dying, um, far, far too early, isn't it, <laugh> It's really not something I'm concerned about at the moment.", "line": 126}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no, absolutely. Fantastic. So let me just summarize. So at the moment, you're, you're single, you've got enough financial dependence, you know, financial liabilities, um, you've got no unencumbered properties, one of them being your main residence, the other that you're renting out and currently receiving rental income for. Um, you have a really strong cash position, you've got a total of 447,000 pounds currently sitting in cash, which is fantastic. Um, you've told me that, uh, recently this has been built up primarily from surplus income, um, and as well as receiving inheritance, uh, in the past from your late mother and your late father.", "line": 127}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yes, that's right. Um, do you mind if we just pause, pause for one second? Um, I think there's someone knocking at my door. I'll be, I'll be back in in one minute.", "line": 128}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no problem at all.", "line": 129}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Hi. Sorry, sorry, the paceman.", "line": 130}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "No, that's, that's quite all right. Don't worry. I'm, I'm very much used to it in this, uh, this working from home environment that we all live in. Um, okay, brilliant. So just to, just to recap what we left off. So you've also got money invested that we're managing for you. Um, you're utilizing your ICE allowance each year as well as your capital gains tax allowance. And you told me, because you find pensions complex, you mainly see your investment as a way of supporting you financially as and when you decide to retire from work.", "line": 131}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "That's right, yes.", "line": 132}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, fantastic. Good. So I know now kind of where you are currently financially, uh, et cetera. I want to start exploring your longer term plans. Okay. And I mentioned at the beginning of this meeting, um, it's co completing what we call a fa a life plan. So just to help me understand kind of your future aspirations and your long-term goals. So what you can see on the screen at the moment, this is, this is call avoidance, uh, this is our cash modeling tool. Okay. I want to focus mainly on the timeline at today's meeting, but really what the cash modeling tool does for us, Mr. Smith, is it kind of uses all of your current informations, all the information you've provided with with regard to your income, your assets, and your expenditure. And it helps us start to model, so some what if scenarios based on what you're trying to achieve for the future. So it helps me to see if you wanted to retire at the age of say 67, will you have enough assets to support you financially, will you have enough income? Um, and we can also take account of any kinda specific plans that you may have, uh, just to make sure that they're stress tested so that you can achieve them. So hopefully that will kind of alleviate any fears that you may or may not have for the long term. Okay?", "line": 133}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay. Yeah, sounds good.", "line": 134}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Now I have to caveat that this is all based on assumptions. Naturally we don't know what's happening tomorrow, let alone in 30 or 40 years time, but it does use factual kind of current up-to-date data with regard to inflation rates and interest rates to kind of model as exactly as we possibly can. Um, so is this something that you went through with your previous advisor?", "line": 135}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, this is the, the first time actually I'm seeing this, so. Okay. Yeah, no, looks, looks really good.", "line": 136}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Good, good. So there's four years, I just wanna focus on which again is your home, occupation, family and lifestyle. So we'll start with your current residence. So your current main residence. Do you enjoy where you live? Do you have any kind of plans, the upsize downsize or a move?", "line": 137}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, I'm very comfortable where I am because um, it's, you know, I'm close to where I work, so I don't have a very long commute. I've got all the amenities, everything around me. So I think this is going to be my home for life. Um, I mean, I'd like to get a bit of decoration done, bring it up to date and um, you know, do a, do a bit. I do try and do a bit every year, buy new stuff for the house, just make it look a bit nicer really.", "line": 138}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah. Nice. And any kinda major renovation works planned?", "line": 139}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I'm just wanting to get like a new sofa, a couple rugs and stuff, you know, well just, uh, up update things really. So I'm thinking, uh, around, I don't expect it to cost more than about 10,000 pounds, I think.", "line": 140}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, so kind of like more decorations than, than major renovations.", "line": 141}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Exactly. Nothing major, nothing structural.", "line": 142}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, good. So your second property, the one that's currently rented out, any plans for that property?", "line": 143}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "I mean, I've been very, very lucky because I've got some really good tenants in there. Um, they've been in there long term. They don't give me much trouble at all. I think because I kept, I keep the rent, um, quite low just to keep them there because I'd rather that they, um, they treat it like a home and as long as they stay, I have no plans. I'm happy with the situation as it is and um, I've always seen it just as a means to provide a bit more financial security when I retire. Really.", "line": 144}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah. Okay. So when would, when would that be a case when you're thinking to retract when you're thinking about retirement? Are you planning to sell to create a lump sum of capital or is it that you plan to continue to, to get income out of that second property?", "line": 145}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Oh, definitely as, as an income. Um, I see the rental, uh, I, I see this rental income as, you know, what's going to become something I'm gonna become reliant upon, as I say, um, have not had to, had to use the pension fund up till now. So I've always thought of my investments and this property as to what's gonna provide me, you know, it, it means, um, to have a bit of a life when, when I do retire.", "line": 146}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Definitely. And do you manage the property yourself or is it done via a letting agent?", "line": 147}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Um, I use to, uh, with, with a letting agent, but because my tenants are long term, kind of let them go, they won't really doing anything and my tenants are so good, they pretty much do all the repairs. Um, and we do have a good relationship, so I manage it myself now.", "line": 148}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Amazing. Any plans to buy any more properties?", "line": 149}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, not just now.", "line": 150}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. Well let's just move on to your occupation then. Uh, so you've told me what you do for a living, you've been there for 20 years, uh, it's an amazing company to work for. What are the plans or aspirations going forward with regard to your aspiration?", "line": 151}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Uh, I mean, um, I find like, like I said, I find my job really, really sort of fulfilling in the sense that I just feel, um, I'm making a real difference. Um, you know, the research that we do, et cetera. So I feel I'm part of the solution there in terms of fulfillment, it's really good. So unless the company closed, there's no aspiration to move on, to be honest. I'm very comfortable there and I think 20 years have passed and I think, well actually I sue myself being there or being well, you know, until I retired, to be honest.", "line": 152}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "And when is retirement for you?", "line": 153}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Well, the company set its retirement date as 65, but I dunno if I'm gonna be ready, you know, to retire then because what am I gonna do? I see my work as my life as well, so maybe I might sort of, I dunno, perhaps go part-time and then fully retire at 67.", "line": 154}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "So slowly reduce your errors rather than coming to a complete standstill.", "line": 155}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, I think I've seen some of my colleagues do that and actually it's been more detrimental to them in the long run.", "line": 156}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, and I guess naturally as you approach 65, 66, our bodies naturally have a good way of telling us whether we can continue or if it's a good time to maybe slow down or stop altogether. But as it stands at the moment, you can't see yourself stopping at 65 and there's a potential to maybe go part-time reduced errors, um, and continue working in, in some capacity.", "line": 157}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, I think so. And plus my state retirement age is much later anyway. It, it's not 65, it'll be 67 I believe.", "line": 158}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, the government keeps changing that, don't they? Uh, it shouldn't really dictate when you retire because again, if you want to retire earlier or later, you can continue working regardless of whether you're receiving a state pension or not. Um, but it is a nice boost of additional income. Um, and you know, you've paid paying national insurance contributions all your life. It's nice to get hopefully something back.", "line": 159}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Yeah, definitely. I suppose I've just never, ever thought of early retirement. I've never really considered it. Yeah.", "line": 160}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Well, retirement really is determined by your financial wellbeing. You know, some people choose not to retire because they're mentally there in a happier place. They work, other people choose to retire later, you know, purely for financial reasons because they've still got a mortgage to pay off or, you know, a family to support. In that sense, you're in a very fortunate position, uh, already because you, you don't have any liabilities.", "line": 161}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Exactly. Exactly.", "line": 162}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "And if I was to ask you, you know, what, uh, what's the main benefit for you to speaking to an advisor? What would be your answer?", "line": 163}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "For me, it's just simply that I've got, um, got a person to go, you know, uh, a go-to person. I have somebody that I can sit down, discuss, explore things, check things. I find it really valuable. So, you know, it's, it's the peace of mind you get, I suppose, from discussing it with someone who knows what they're actually doing.", "line": 164}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah, no, absolutely. Um, so the last part of your kinda life plan I just wanted to touch upon is your current lifestyle. So I understand we can do a job, um, uh, for you, but I want to understand what, you know, what do you do outside of work? You know, what pleases you, what gives you enjoyment in life?", "line": 165}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Okay, well, so I mentioned holidays. So Nikki, my best friend and I, we go and we blow out and we go on a biggie holiday every other year. So we really push the boat out and we plan it. Um, and occasionally, you know, Serena comes with us and sometimes, most of the time it's, it's just Nicki and I, but we go somewhere every other year somewhere exhausted, you know, for maybe three, four weeks. Um, this year I'll be going to Australia. I'm extremely interested in nature and stuff. So yeah, so that's our trip next year. Um, so well, and, and then in between, you know, in the year that we don't go away, then we'll go on lots of European city breaks and um, maybe Serena comes along on some of those.", "line": 166}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Yeah. So you enjoy traveling?", "line": 167}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Most definitely. Um, you know, that, uh, I mean it's, it's, it's so much fun planning, finding a destination and then planning and working out your itinerary. I really look forward to that.", "line": 168}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay. So it definitely sounds like you're maintaining a busy lifestyle if you're earning the money, it's good to spend it on things that you're enjoying doing.", "line": 169}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Absolutely.", "line": 170}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, so thank you for that. That's really given me a good understanding of obviously where you are now, uh, what you're trying to achieve. Um, you know, when you kind of go past into retirement, it's gonna be kinda much of the same in the sense that you want to continue traveling and enjoy this active, healthy lifestyle that you currently live.", "line": 171}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Definitely. I mean, I would hope Nick and I are, uh, both the, the same age, so I would hope Health allowing, you know, at least until the age of 80 that I can carry on doing the same sort of thing.", "line": 172}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Okay, good. So, well thank you for that. That definitely gives me a much clearer picture as to what you're trying to achieve long term. Um, so what, what I would suggest is that we probably leave the meeting there for today, Mr. Smith. Um, we probably need to come and touch on, uh, protection, but I think we could probably leave that for an interim review meeting. I'll follow up after this and just give you a few dates in the diary, um, for getting that in place. But as I say, I think for today we've got more than enough to go on. Um, and I think that we, yeah, we've, we've identified that your, your current, your current, uh, portfolio is on the right track. I think your risk profile is still in line with what it was five years ago, so we're very much on track, so great to meet you. Um, I will follow up with an email on that interim review meeting, as I said, and obviously there's that bit of paperwork that we discussed early in the meeting, um, which I just again, uh, recommend that you read through one more time. Any questions for, for me before we finish up?", "line": 173}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "No, I, I think that's everything. Thank you for your time. It's, it's been really helpful. Um, and, and as I say, it's, it's good to speak to someone who knows what they're doing.", "line": 174}, {"speaker": "Adviser", "content": "Brilliant. Well thanks very much Mr. Smith. Great to meet you. And as I say, we'll, we'll catch up again soon.", "line": 175}, {"speaker": "Client", "content": "Excellent. Thanks very much.", "line": 176}]}
