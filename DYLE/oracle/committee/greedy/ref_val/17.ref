sian gwenllian am pointed out that it was recommended that qr funding should be maintained in real terms , but the sum had not actually increased over a period of nine years .
dr david blaney explained the reason as there was not enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations to other bits of the he system .
although it was very clear about the importance of investing in qr research funding but the current capacity would not allow this ambition .
however , it would be regarded as a fundamental approach .
