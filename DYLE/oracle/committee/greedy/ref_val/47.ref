the meeting was about caring welsh children during the outbreak of covid-19 .
due to the coronavirus , the state was locked down and a strict social distance was required , and then most schools in welsh were shut down .
the group was concerned whether the existing support was enough to ensure their children get through such a period healthily , in terms of both mentally and physically .
they listed several possible solutions , including having the vaccination on the susceptible group , offering psychological support for the children as well as the pregnant women , and raising a contingency fund .
through their asking and answering with the ministers , the group finally agreed on a bright blueprint for the education and economic recovery in welsh .
