dr david blaney introduced that there was proper governance oversight since the estates strategies that institutions operate were overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution .
the government was content with the fact that the governance machinery within the institutions was structured appropriately and if the universities would like to engage any other things than trivial borrowing , they need to get the government consent as well .
to prevent universities from breaking the loan , the government included close monitoring considering the change of borrowing in the system , as well as constant ongoing monitoring .
