so , overall , you 're painting a picture of a sector that 's under a significant degree of financial stress , and this is obviously using your key financial indicators .
do you monitor each and every university , or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is ?
are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years ?
and then—sorry .
how can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent ?
right , okay .
so , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ?
thank you .
now , the minister talks of one skills system .
how do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between he and fe ?
thank you .
we 're going to go to hefin david now for some questions on part-time student funding .
could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students ?
and likewise , in 2019-20 , there will be allocations specifically for this .
so , again , the reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us .
and we endorse , just as the government has endorsed , the recommendations from reid .
the government has committed in principle to delivering reid .
the challenge is finding the money , and we fully understand that .
there has been an additional £6.6 million allocated for research very recently by the government , which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from reid .
so , that 's a start , but that 's not sustainable funding , and it 's not enough , really , but it is a good and welcome start .
reid was also not just talking about the money , but also talking about the way in which the welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with uk-wide developments .
and in response to that , we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation , which was developed over a number of months , following the reid report closely , working with stakeholders , including the welsh government , in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future , including the reduction , potentially , of access to eu funds .
and a lot of that is— .
these reid recommendations all come together ; they 're coherent .
a lot of that requires investment in the welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a uk level .
since it seems possible at least , and possibly even likely , that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the eu will sit in london rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the welsh government 's position on that , and we do n't disagree with it .
but either way , we need a research base that 's able to compete , and that 's why the investment recommendations of reid are so important .
