in april , the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile .
can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of ppe for china on january 31 , claiming it would not compromise our supply ?
she ca n't have it both ways .
we do n't have enough ; we have enough and it wo n't compromise it .
