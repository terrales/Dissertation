mr.chair , we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of covid-19 .
people work for those organizations , as accountants , receptionists , assistants or labourers , and those people need to be supported .
we are supporting people all over the country through that program .
mr.chair , all through this pandemic , our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs .
this applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible .
that is what we are in the process of doing .
does answering a question put the prime minister in difficulty ?
