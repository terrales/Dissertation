the definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs , and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised .
but we have now looked at this again , and we 've set out an expanded definition , and we intend to publish that this week .
this does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services .
because , obviously , the children that we know about , we know about , but there are those other children who may be on the edge of careâ€”the children that we 've been trying very hard , as part of our policies in the welsh government , to keep with their families , with a lot of support .
those are the ones that we also want to support .
so , we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility , and that will be published this week .
yes , that would be very good .
