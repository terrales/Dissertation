but i have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in trinity saint david 's financial plans .
we might .
and then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the european union .
of course , this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research , and the reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact .
so , what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from eu funding ?
is that part of the ukri funding ?
there is some Â£7 billion in the hands of that organisation , as i understand it , and there may be some possibilities there too .
