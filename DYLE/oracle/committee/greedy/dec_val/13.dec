so , what about risk appetite ?
do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite ?
i think there 's a mixture of things going on .
we have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing .
so , you have a governing body with a range of perspectives , and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution , and just occasionally it 's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things .
so , i do n't think it 's a shortfall as such , but i just thinkâ€” right , okay .
so , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ?
