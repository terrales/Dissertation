currently , with our current providers , there is a significant geographical spread .
there are centres here in the south-east , there are centres in the south-west , in mid wales , and in north wales .
obviously , accessibility is an issue for us .
we do think that , for some students , accessibility is an issue , and of course that 's why we are responding with our part-time pgce route , which actually will be location neutral , because you will be able to study that as a distance learner , and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course .
so , that 's part of the attractiveness , i believe , of offering that to people .
so , if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher , our new part-time pgce , as i said , will allow them to do that .
julie on this .
