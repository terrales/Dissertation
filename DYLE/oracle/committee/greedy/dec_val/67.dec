mr. chair , this government is refusing to come to terms with what covid-19 will mean for the future of international trade .
why is canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same ?
mr. chair , we are monitoring the situation very carefully .
the u.k. , of course , is a very important trading partner for canada .
they are in discussions right now .
i want to assure canadian businesses that ceta continues to apply to our trade with the u.k. during this period while they go through brexit .
