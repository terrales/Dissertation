in terms of in-patient capacity , that is in the system in both the north wales and in the south wales unit at the moment .
there were some discharges of young people , but we 've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place .
well , it 's been a very difficult time , as you appreciate , in terms of having to make legislation very quickly , and it has n't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do .
however , i am very pleased to say that we 're actually launching a survey of children .
we 're going to be launching it next week .
and this is to try to get from children their views of what 's happened , what we 've been doing , and their views on the whole covid-19 situation .
so , we 're doing this in conjunction with the children 's commissioner and with young wales and with the youth parliament .
so , this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children , and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them , what they feel about what 's happened during this period , what they feel about the way that we 've dealt with the schools , the way that they 've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long .
and so we 're trying to get feedback from young people .
so , i 'm very pleased that we 're doing that , but , in terms of an impact assessment , it has been very difficult , as i 'm sure you can imagine , to be able to do those at these times .
i think that albert wants to come in on that .
