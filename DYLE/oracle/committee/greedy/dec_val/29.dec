i would n't use the word 'agnostic ' , but what i 'm in favour of is a healthy , strong and sustainable he sector .
if individual institutions wish to collaborate or , indeed , go further to a formal merger then , obviously , that is a matter for them .
we 're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers , but , if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students , obviously , we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans , but that 's a matter for individual institutions .
you did .
