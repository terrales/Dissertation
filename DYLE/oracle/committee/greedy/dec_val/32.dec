julie on this .
thank you very much .
the next question is from dawn bowden .
well , we are listening and speaking to colegaucymru , and also we 're aware of what the unions are saying as well .
so , i think that 's probably as far as we can go at this point .
when they come to a conclusion , and when they come to us and say , 'look , this is the consequence and this will finish'â€”at this point , we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall .
let 's wait for the outcome of the negotiations .
i think we are very aware of the situation .
colegaucymru are in that negotiation .
we 're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members , and we 'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally .
