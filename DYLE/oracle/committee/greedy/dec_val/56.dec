have camhs staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak ?
the deputy minister would like to come in , i think .
we have worked with the fostering organisations .
we have had close communications with them , and we 've supported afa cymru to develop guidance for foster carers , and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector .
we 're working with the third sector .
i think i mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and , of course , care leavers .
the fostering network has extended its helpline hours , and , of course , voices from care—i mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers .
i 've been reassured , as well , from voices from care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with .
but that 's online help for them .
so , we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services .
yes , that would be very good .
