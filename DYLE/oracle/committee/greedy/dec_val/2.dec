the honourable minister .
the honourable minister of industry .
the honourable minister of public safety .
i really do want to acknowledge my honourable colleague for his advocacy .
i just want to assure him that while the government remains committed to implementing policies in our platform , we are focused on this health crisis right now .
we have provided financial support to seniors sooner through the gst credit top-up , and now with additional payments to oas and gis recipients .
this year we are investing over twice as much on financial assistance for seniors as we committed to in our platform , which is $ 3.8 billion compared to $ 1.56 billion in the platform .
seniors need our help and we 're delivering .
these payments have provided greater support for the most vulnerable seniors .
just to give some details , for those on oas and gis , they will get , in conjunction with the gst credit top-up , $ 875 per adult , and over $ 1,500 per couple .
this is not an insignificant amount .
this is a significant amount to support our seniors during this pandemic .
