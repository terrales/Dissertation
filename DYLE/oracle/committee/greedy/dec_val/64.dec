mr. chair , as we stated , this report was done and given up through the chain of command , and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence .
once we received this report , it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities .
again , i want to commend our canadian armed forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty .
