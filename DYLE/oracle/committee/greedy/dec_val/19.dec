thank you , bethan .
i was just going to add that , when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in wales , compared with the rest of the uk , it 's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in england , so the figures show that we receive less of the money that 's available , which is a factor that results from us having less qr as a percentage , so we 're in a situation where we get less of that uk funding that 's available as well .
and likewise , in 2019-20 , there will be allocations specifically for this .
