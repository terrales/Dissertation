that was going to be my next question .
thank you very much .
the next question is from dawn bowden .
thanks very much for that .
i think , first of all , you 're absolutely right—this is about colegaucymru 's negotiation , but we are keeping a close eye on the situation .
i think it 's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about , or part of the reason , is because you 've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers ' pay and we 've had the consequential .
so , sixth-form teachers are happy .
the people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution , you can understand why they may say , 'something needs to change here . '
the problem here is that it 's about that , actually , that falls to the welsh government .
we do n't have that .
or at least it falls to fe colleges to fund that , and it 's up to them to come up with that proposal .
we are keeping a close eye on things .
i think it 's fair to say that we 'll wait until they get further along down the line , but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation .
well , we are listening and speaking to colegaucymru , and also we 're aware of what the unions are saying as well .
so , i think that 's probably as far as we can go at this point .
when they come to a conclusion , and when they come to us and say , 'look , this is the consequence and this will finish'—at this point , we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall .
in relation to teaching , i think it 's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching , yes .
