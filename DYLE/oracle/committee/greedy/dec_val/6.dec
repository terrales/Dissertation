mr. poilievre is next .
mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question .
i want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment .
when we originally proposed this initiative , the threshold was 30 % for the month of march .
now businesses will only need to show a 15 % decline in revenue , and businesses will have the option of using january and february as a reference period to show revenue losses , or of using the same time last year .
this reflects , again , our ability to understand the needs of businesses , to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative .
mr. chair , the member for carleton said that the previous government spent more on the auditor general than the current government , and that is actually incorrect .
