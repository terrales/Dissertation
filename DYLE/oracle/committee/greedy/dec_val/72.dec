mr. chair , thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern , which we share .
we understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges , and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable .
considering the severity of this report , we promptly shared it with the province of ontario , and the province of ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report 's findings .
their investigation includes alerting the province 's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction .
we will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities , and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding canadian armed forces and in our partnership with the red cross .
