again , mr. chair , i want to highlight the fact that this has been a very positive program and well received by many small businesses .
over 590,000 small business loans have been issued , and that 's a testament to the design of the program .
we 're going to make sure we continue to engage with small businesses .
the honourable minister .
thank you , mr.chair .
we are making progress , but unfortunately , i 'd like to hear it in french as well .
i will address my question to the prime minister .
first , let me remind you that , on march12 , the government announced a first series of measures of about $ 1billion to adapt to what was at the time the beginning of the coronavirus crisis , including $ 500million in transfers to the provinces , with about $ 100million going to quebec .
since that time , the commitments from the government have reached very probably around $ 300billion , making those first $ 500 million pale by comparison .
of course , the crisis became longer and it is not over yet .
in that context , and given what i heard the prime minister say a little earlier about respecting the areas of jurisdiction of the provinces , and of quebec , can we expect a speedy increase in health transfers to quebec and the provinces , an increase that would be permanent , and , of course , without conditions ?
