mr. chair , we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly , and that 's what we did .
we rolled out the canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly .
eight million canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of covid-19 .
we also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses .
what we 've done in terms of helping small businesses with the canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country , but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it 's a little more difficult for them to qualify .
we are working with them through their regional development agencies , and we encourage them to approach their local rdas , which will be able to help them get the money they deserve .
does answering a question put the prime minister in difficulty ?
how many businesses have received funding under the bcap co-lending program since march ?
