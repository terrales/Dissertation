yes , so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution , so there is proper governance oversight .
and in all of those instances , there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates .
so , the machinery is in placeâ€” okay .
we 're content on two fronts : one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that , but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing , they have to get our consent as well .
and what we do n't do is second-guess everything , but what we do do is make sure that the governing body , or its relevant committees , have been asking the right questions .
so , there are two bits to this .
