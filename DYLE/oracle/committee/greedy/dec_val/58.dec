hello .
yes , those are the questions i had on that section .
okay , and we are going to come onto children 's rights .
but , as you know , minister , the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart .
can i ask what assessment the welsh government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic ?
thank you , chair .
i just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the minister , i think , about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed , about which children 's rights impact assessments have been done .
have any been done , and can they be shared with the committee if they have ?
sorry , deputy minister—my mistake .
well , i think , as albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care .
you know , that's—there have n't been any in wales .
i do n't have that at the moment .
