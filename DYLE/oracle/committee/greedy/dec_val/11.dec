when you talk about structural change , are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close ?
i bring this up because i 'm the assembly member for carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire , and i have had multiple representations from students , and their parents , who are about to go to lampeter and who 've been told that courses are being restructured , there 's a massive staff loss , and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they 're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained .
so i am trying to drill down a little bit , because i think it 's only fair for the students to know what they 're up against , and also it 's a bit like in the great depressionâ€”you can start a run on something , ca n't you ?
because if enough people believe it , then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university , really top-quality in medieval literature , in archaeology .
and i 'm just talking about one , but i know there are problems in other universities around wales , so i just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as hefcw might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes .
but i have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in trinity saint david 's financial plans .
i 've just written 'independent and autonomous ' .
absolutely .
the challenge is all of us being clear what constitutes best practice .
just in the interest of transparency , are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk ?
