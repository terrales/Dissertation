hello .
yes , those are the questions i had on that section .
thank you .
nicola .
thanks .
in terms of childcare and education , we 're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements , and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those .
obviously , the coronavirus act itself was uk government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments , but , in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space—and i think albert was just saying the same thing—we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward .
well , i think , as albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care .
you know , that's—there have n't been any in wales .
i do n't have that at the moment .
briefly , if possible .
