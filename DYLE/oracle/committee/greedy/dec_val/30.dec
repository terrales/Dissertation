i , personally , am not aware of any disadvantage to cardiff met , but i would recognise—i would absolutely recognise—for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues , then that would have had a personal impact on them .
in terms of the institution going forward , i 'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion .
and , as i said , i 'm really heartened by some of the really interesting collaborative work that cardiff met are interested in doing , and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions , whether that be cardiff uni or local colleges , and i think that 's to be welcomed .
