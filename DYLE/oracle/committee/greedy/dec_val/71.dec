mr. chair , i would say that all canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes .
we 're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals .
we also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care .
we have to do better as a country .
these are our loved ones .
these are our parents and our grandparents .
these are the people in our lives who have given so much to us .
i stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society .
we know that there 's a role we can play at the federal level with advice , with guidance , with support and , yes , with investments .
we look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us .
i would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair .
the honourable minister .
