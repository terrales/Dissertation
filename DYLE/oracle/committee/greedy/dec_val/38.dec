and what about the view , given that you said that capacity was n't an issue , of the national day nurseries association , which says that wales has the most fragile childcare sector in great britain ?
that 's fair enough , but is it realistic to think that there 's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product ?
is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing ?
