of course .
not just on the work we 've done in the past ; not just because it 's one of the key principles for the education minister about the reopening of schools , but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and to move forwards , that we do n't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we have n't thought about what that will look like .
so , the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me .
in amongst all the other priorities i have , i 'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten .
i do n't have that at the moment .
yes , that would be very good .
