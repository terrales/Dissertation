i think it 's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we 're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in wales , and it 's about the financial pressures that we 've already discussed this morning .
and that is why the efforts that the minister has gone to to secure the diamond settlement , and , indeed , other bits of money now and again , are so important .
so , she 's doing what she can , and that 's really good , but we always knew that , between the point of the diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation , there was going to be a valley to cross .
the new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well .
so , the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure ; there 's a demographic dip , and there are the other contextual factors we 've discussed .
we always knew there was going to be a valley .
and the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really do n't have to take out , because they do n't want to reduce capacity , which they 'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves .
so , they are seeing deficits , which are managed deficits , where they 're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in .
so , they 're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this .
right , okay .
so , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ?
