well , first of all , as i tried to illustrate to suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak welsh and to be able to use— —the language and skills .
and if we look at qualifiers of ite courses in wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend—we see numbers going up .
so , there are statistics and there are statistics .
depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture .
and that 's why we had the evaluation report .
we understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done .
that 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ite and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward .
we know what we need to do .
as i said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things .
we are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation .
