thank you .
the next questions are from suzy davies .
thanks .
how is welsh government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks ?
yes .
in terms of the provision in schools , we 're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment .
in terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme , it has only been two weeks up and running really , so the numbers are quite low , but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week , and of those , just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children .
so , it is picking up there ; it was 900 children the week before that , so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there .
