no .
okay .

item 2 this morning , then , is a session with the minister for children and social care on the welsh government 's childcare offer .
so , i 'm very pleased to welcome huw irranca-davies , minister for children and social care , also jo-anne daniels , director for communities and tackling poverty , and owain lloyd , deputy director for childcare , play and early years .
so , thank you , all , for your attendance .
if you 're happy , we 'll go straight into questions from members , and the first questions come from hefin david .
good morning , minister .
how has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas , and is it something of a mixed bag ?
and what about the view , given that you said that capacity was n't an issue , of the national day nurseries association , which says that wales has the most fragile childcare sector in great britain ?
but they 've raised concerns about the national living wage implications , have n't they , as well ?
so , it 's not fair to say that they have n't raised concerns about the rate .
david , you had a question on the pilots .
and what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive ?
