i would n't use the word 'agnostic ' , but what i 'm in favour of is a healthy , strong and sustainable he sector .
if individual institutions wish to collaborate or , indeed , go further to a formal merger then , obviously , that is a matter for them .
we 're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers , but , if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students , obviously , we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans , but that 's a matter for individual institutions .
okay .
that 's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors , then .
okay .
the reason i say it is because i was kind of on the inside when cardiff metropolitan university was under pressure from the then minister to merge with the university of glamorgan and newport .
it was a very difficult time for staff and , indeed , for students .
you had the university and college union and the minister pushing it ; the vice-chancellor of cardiff met at the time very much against it .
so , do you think that it 's reallyâ€” ?
you 're agnostic , but do you think perhaps it 's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students ?
julie on this .
you did .
