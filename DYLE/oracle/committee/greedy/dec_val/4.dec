mr. chair , i want to highlight the fact that we have issued 590,000 loans through the ceba account .
this demonstrates that this particular program is working and that businesses are taking advantage of it .
we recognize that we want to be more generous and more thoughtful about these programs .
we 've demonstrated flexibility in the past and we will continue to be nimble going forward .
will the government fix ceba to cover small businesses that hire day labourers or subcontractors ?
the member for rimouski-neigettetmiscouatalesbasques , mr.blanchette-joncas , has the floor .
