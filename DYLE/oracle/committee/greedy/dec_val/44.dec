so , it 's not fair to say that they have n't raised concerns about the rate .
david , you had a question on the pilots .
okay .
so , moving on , then , to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness , of course , which is an important one to address .
clearly , one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children , hopefully , later on in life .
i want to come back to this point that the children 's commissioner for wales and others have raised : the concern that , actually , the most disadvantaged—those from workless households—are being excluded from this policy .
is n't there therefore a risk that they 'll be left even further behind ?
perhaps i can frame my question in another way .
are you prepared to consider it if you 're able to identify the numbers and potential cost ?
