thank you , suzy .
i think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months .
but what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets .
so , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs .
so , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ite provision is world class , so that , actually , welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher .
you 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ite provision that will start in the next academic year .
we have looked at financial incentives .
it 's not the whole answer , i think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do .
you 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now Â£20,000 a year .
we 're also embarking on our first ever national ite recruitment marketing exercise .
we have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in wales .
we are now part of a full national programme of ite recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher .
so , there 's a whole package of things we need to do .
in january of this year i set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next .
okay .
well , that 's what i was after finding out , and , actually , what you 've just said about the part-time pgce is pretty interesting as well , because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching , that 's got to help , has n't it ?
we are aware of their position , yes .
