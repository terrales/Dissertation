mr. chair , the constitution of canada is not an excuse .
it lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities , and we respect the provinces ' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities .
however , from the very beginning , we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue .
we need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for , which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces .
the military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten .
will the prime minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the canada health act ?
