in terms of the overall numbers , we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need .
so , in terms of an overall number of places , we will commission from those accredited units .
clearly , there will be a responsibility upon the university of south wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course , with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme .
well , that 's a matter for them .
julie on this .
