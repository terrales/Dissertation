and , there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates .
so , for example , cardiff university have had a bond rather than borrowing , which you draw down as you 're spending .
so , in the short term , the reserves of cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances , but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and , over the next two or three years , will be utilised for that .
are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years ?
indeed , it is .
okay , which isâ€”some of the work you 've suggested will help towards that .
bethan , did you want to say something on this ?
thank you very much .
