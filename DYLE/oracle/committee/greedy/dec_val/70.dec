mr.chair , the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government .
we will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes .
let me be clear : in everything we do , we will target companies and not innocent workers .
employees are employees , no matter who they work for .
mr.chair , we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across canada .
that 's our approach , and i believe it 's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic .
