the military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority .
will the prime minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the canada health act ?
mr. chair , i want to make it very clear : when it comes to the observations that were made , those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province .
at the same time , this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command , and they did their due diligence .
as i stated , it was given to us , and on the same day it was forwarded to the minister of public safety , who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities .
mr.chair , the minister 's answer is not fluid at all .
but the question is really simple : how much is canada 's deficit ?
mr.chair , i want to be very clear with canadians : our economic situation is very difficult .
the situation is fluid .
we are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future .
could they go on monday ?
