thank you , bethan .
and , just to add , i think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of welsh universities to students , because a large proportion are coming not from just wales , but from england and internationally—so , that 's a key part—and also that our research portfolio is invested in , and that also brings economic benefits .
so , i think those are the two that we are [ correction : need to be ] able to maintain : the institutions as attractive options for students , and that our research capacity is invested in .
