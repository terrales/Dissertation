and how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in wales ?
have you had to shift some resources over from camhs , for example , in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus ?
yes , they continue to be available .
we still have seven-day-a-week crisis care .
we 've made clear that mental health services , including those for children and young people , are essential services to be provided .
they 're not services to be scaled down .
they were not part of the series of measures that i stopped within the health service on 13 march .
we have built up those crisis care services over a period of time , and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health .
i do n't have that at the moment .
briefly , if possible .
