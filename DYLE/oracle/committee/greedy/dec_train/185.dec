mr. chair , this government was the first government to recognize anti-black racism , systemic discrimination and unconscious bias and to take concrete actions against them in the context of the un international decade for people of african descent but also in the context of a country that stands up for human rights and protects everyone .
we have made significant steps forward , but there is so much to do , and i look forward to working with all members in this house to do just that .
mr. chair , not at all .
the contracts that we are entering into are made by us
