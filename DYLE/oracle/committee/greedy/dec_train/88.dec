what , if a child is being smacked now ?
simply to say that i think that , in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted—seriously assaulted and abused by their parents , which goes on on a daily basis—that is already covered by existing legislation .
but at the moment , they do n't know , because they could be being told—and they probably are being told—by their parents that 's it 's okay , that they can smack their child and that that 's acceptable .
they do n't know the difference .
a young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is— .
and if you asked most parents , and in fact lots of professionals , they would not be able to tell you , and probably most of you would n't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold—
