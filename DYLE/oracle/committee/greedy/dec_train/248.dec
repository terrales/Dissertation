just to build on what the minister has said , there 's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector , and some of that is about providing information .
so , hefcw provides information—it sends around circulars , it produces reports and it holds events .
there 's staff , management and leadership development activity , which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions , but also amongst their governing bodies , to help them move in a particular direction .
we would hope that 's in the direction of the civic university approach that the minister has outlined .
we use those mechanisms and informal interactions with fe college principals , with the work-based learning provider network , with sixth forms and others , and we would want to see , i hope , in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things .
when things go badly wrong , there are a range of mechanisms .
i think what stands behind hefcw 's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance , there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by hefcw .
i do n't think we 're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances— dawn .
