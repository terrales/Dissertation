yes .
so , thank you for that explanation .
that is one of the reasons , but there were issues about the welsh language , which we can go into in detail , if you 'd like .
there were some issues about that .
they would be able to process things bilingually , and i think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the hmrc .
but , in terms of the welsh language standards that the minister has to use , there would be some difficulties in them doing it .
with limits , yes .
