the canada emergency student benefit does not encourage young people to go to work , and employers have difficulty hiring them .
yet they had applied for the canada summer jobs program .
why not enhance the canada summer jobs program ?
mr. chair , i 'm sure the member opposite is not implying that offering young people income support that they take out of necessity will make them not want to work .
young people want to work .
they want to serve in their communities .
that 's why we 're creating these additional jobs beyond the canada summer jobs program .
that 's why we 've increased the flexibilities in the canada summer jobs program .
it 's so we can maximize these programs .
