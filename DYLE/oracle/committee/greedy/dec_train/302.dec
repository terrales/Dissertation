clearly , we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the eu and from around the world .
the fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on european union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that wales , up until now , has been successful in recruiting international students .
so , the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students , because , actually , international students outside of the eu make up a bigger proportion of students not from the uk who come to our institutions .
the financial allocation , as i said , was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues , but if you 'd like further details i can provide those as much as i 'm able .
so , could you say that , if they keep their promises , then at least that level of funding would be maintained ?
if there 's no dealâ€”
