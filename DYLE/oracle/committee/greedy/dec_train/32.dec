going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of wales , the welsh and uk governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents .
is that a mistake ?
should it be more universally available ?
i know that—we 've just had a useful briefing from david dallimore , and , basically , there is this theory that there are too many resources—the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way .
how do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds , in their own peer or age group ?
i think the point that janet 's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas , so there 's not a level playing field to start from .
is that correct ?
