obviously , the most important resource for the education system is the teachers .
so , it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit .
and we 're not seeing them hit , if i remember correctly , even in primary , let alone secondary .
so , there is a challenge , and i think we 've got to look at this in the round .
we 've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this .
so , long term , we 've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into .
so , that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being .
i think there 's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda , that people need to take that seriously , and there 's work going on regarding the workload issue .
these would be children from three to five .
