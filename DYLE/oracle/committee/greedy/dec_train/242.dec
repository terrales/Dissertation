as i said , we are facing unprecedented circumstances .
the normal rules of engagement have to change and , those organisations , we 'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal , and we would n't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that .
our call to the youth service is a call to arms , though .
when we 're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children , they have a valuable role to play and i know that local government and the council for wales of voluntary youth services are already in discussion about how youth servicesâ€” .
many of our youth services work on an outreach basis .
those traditional youth clubs , because of austerity , are not necessarily there anymore , so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work , and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier .
