mr. chair , it is a great honour to speak to the house of commons today from whitehorse , yukon , here on the traditional territory of the kwanlin dn first nation and the ta'an kwch'n council .
as a great historic canadian event last week , yukon became home to canada 's first university north of 60. yukon university will provide yukoners with educational opportunities closer to home , expand our research capabilities and expertise on the arctic and climate change and allow those who want to study northern and first nations governance to do so in the north .
i encourage all students living in the northern half of canada to look at the many programs and degrees at yukon university to continue their studiesin some cases this year , virtuallyby remaining in the north .
i want to congratulate the staff of yukon college , who spent the last decade working towards this transition , and especially the outgoing president , karen barnes .
i wish her all the best in her retirement .
thank you , merci , mahsi cho and sga senl .
