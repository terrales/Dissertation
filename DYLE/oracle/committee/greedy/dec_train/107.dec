yes , the lastest data was out last week .

okay .
and finally , with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools , do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils ?
so , you think that 's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet .
