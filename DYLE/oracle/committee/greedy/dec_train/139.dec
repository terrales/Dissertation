it was mr. chair , the honourable member spoke about farmers generally .
the program today is $ 252 million , which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers , of course , have access to .
on potato farmers , in particular , i agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern .
i think all canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used , and that 's why the $ 50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful .
