what is swansea 's success , then ?
what can we learn from swansea ?
what i think is important—and this is not about any one institution—what i think is really important is that we look to— .
and i ca n't force institutions to do this .
it 's a combination , i believe , for all universities , of getting their offer right—so , having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study .
it 's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion , so high quality ratings for teaching , as well as having an infrastructure that is attractive to students .
so , it 's all about getting the offer right and providing what students , both domestically and internationally , want .
thank you .
suzy , you had a supplementary .
