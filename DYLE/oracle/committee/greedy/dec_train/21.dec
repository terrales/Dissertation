and rightly so .
it was only three words .
well , neath port talbot would need to demonstrate to me how they 're going to address these issues .
if they 're not part of erw and their schools and their children are not going to be in receipt of the support from erw , as i said , especially at this critical time , how are they intending to do that ?
i have n't seen those plans , but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice , i would want to see them and i suspect estyn would want to see them also .
okay .
thank you for that .
