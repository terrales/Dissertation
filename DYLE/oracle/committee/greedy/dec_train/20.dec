i think it 's really disappointing that neath port talbot have published that notice .
what 's important for me is to understandâ€”not for me , it will be important for estyn .
it will be really important for us to understand how neath port talbot intend to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from erw , especially at what is a very , very critical time .
the regional consortia have a key role to play in supporting systems with the introduction of the curriculum .
i would want to know from neath port talbot how they are going to do that without being part of that organisation .
and , of course , there 's the added complexity that so much of our money is channelled through to schools via the regional consortia .
so , i would want to understand from neath port talbot how they 're going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who are receiving their education in neath port talbot are not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision .
