suzy , what i believe that we 're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school .
so , there has been , i know , a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they 're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children , and to be able to give them the confidence that there are—that the hubs are available for them .
so , we have seen an increase in children .
those numbers are still small and , i believe , potentially , there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children , whether that— .
that vulnerability , of course , can cover a whole range of issues .
as i said when we last met , this is a constantly evolving situation .
the initial response—local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs .
we 've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and i am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches .
