philip .
but satisfactory ?
i think , for a new model , that needs to be determined .
welsh government has a role in curriculum at the moment .
they have responsibility for curriclum and they 've already started work with the seminar last year , and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future .
i think we need to evolve that approach , and i think welsh government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment .
