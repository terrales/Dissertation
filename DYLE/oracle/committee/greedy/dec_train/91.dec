i do n't think it 's a matter of mistrust—it 's a matter of , you know , if a professional believes , based on the evidence that they have , because they 're working with that child every day , that there is significant harm to that child , they are under a duty to report that to social care .
so , part of the work is with families , and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent .
that consent is a key element of this , and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually , 'you need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them . '
some of the nfas—the ones that do n't get referred at threshold—it will come back to school for , possibly , some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect .
so , i do n't think— .
the trust in the professionals—it 's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-wales safeguarding procedures .
that 's what engenders trust in a professional workforce .
