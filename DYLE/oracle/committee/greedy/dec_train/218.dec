mr. chair , i agree with the member opposite that after what we have learned this week , all options must be on the table when it comes to how care for our elders will be provided in canada in the future .
i think it is clear to us all that root-and-branch reform is necessary .
we need to act with speed but not haste , and work with our provincial partners .
