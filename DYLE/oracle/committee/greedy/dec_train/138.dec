mr.chair , i feel that all canadians were affected by the massacre in nova scotia .
once again , too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief .
during the last election campaign , we promised to ban military-style assault weapons , and that is exactly what we have done .
we will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control .
it is a shame that , once more , the conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country .
there are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released .
the honourable minister .
on a point of order
