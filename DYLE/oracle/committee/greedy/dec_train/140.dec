it was the honourable minister .
in a time of coronavirus that is even more the case , and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions .
i want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair to avoid back and forth , just to try to keep some order in the meeting .
ms. mcpherson , please continue .
i 'm sorry , chair .
i have another question on the protection for workers .
at the meat-packing plant , workers are calling for the plant to be shut down .
in fact , we know that 85 % of workers are afraid for their safety .
if the provincial government wo n't shut down the plant , will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the canadian food inspection agency ?
