thank you .
gareth .
our view in the wjec is that subsidy will be necessary .
but we could rethink the model for the subsidy , perhaps .
at the moment , the subsidy is described as a subsidy for the welsh-medium version .
why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the welsh curriculum ?
and perhaps we would need a little more funding for that .
but there will be organisations such as the wjec who will still be interested in contributing , because we are a charity , and within our mission is investment in various things that supports education in wales .
it would be possible .
