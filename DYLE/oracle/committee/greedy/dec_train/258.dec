mr. chair , i am wondering how the prime minister could explain to a bus driver in vancouver who has been laid off that as a public sector worker , she ca n't access the federal wage subsidy , while an equivalent worker in the airline industry gets to keep her job with the federal help of that program .
could the prime minister explain how that is fair ?
