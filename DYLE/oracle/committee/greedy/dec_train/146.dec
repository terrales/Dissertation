thank you once again for that .
the smooth operation of the hubs , with regard to health and safety , is , of course , of paramount importance .
what we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function—we have seen a change of pattern over time .
so , following my announcement on , i believe , 18 march , the week after , we saw a large number of settings open and operating .
as local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places—from critical workers and vulnerable children—we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model , and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed , and we 've been able to give guidance in that regard .
local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground .
obviously , the ability to be able to test , to trace and to quarantine will be critical to the next phase and will be a very , very important and significant building block in all aspects of the government 's work to respond to this pandemic .
