this being a committee , we can have a point of order during what would have been question period .
i am not sitting that far away from the prime minister , and i 'm sorry , but andrew scheer used to be the speaker of the house and should show better decorum .
well , that was n't at all what the artists and creators who were out demonstrating in the streets a few days ago thought .
they were protesting on the weekend .
the cerb extension announced by the government only brings us to september , but the cultural community is expecting the worst in the fall .
what is the government 's long-term plan to support creators and their entire teams ?
