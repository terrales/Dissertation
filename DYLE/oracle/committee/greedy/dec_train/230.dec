i think special schools have already been hit by this challenge , because a significant proportion of their children , because of their conditions , have not been coming to school , they 've been isolated .
but the principle we 've used there is , actually , even if it 's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable , they deserve and need that support through the school .
so , we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children .
but similarly , even in special schools , there will be children whose parents will be key workers , so we would expect them to apply that same principle .
just quickly in response to the earlier question , while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools , we â€™ ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely , given the nature of the special school , so we would look to cater for that within the original school .
