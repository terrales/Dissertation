have you been given any indication at all by the chief medical officer as to when , in the longer term , it might be ?
but these principles do n't apply in those circumstances ; these are principles for schools only .
oh , thank you .
my question goes back to the comment you made earlier , minister , about the number of children doubling—sorry , vulnerable children doubling—after the easter break , if we can call it that .
so , what i 'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments .
so , was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the easter break , and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown ?
