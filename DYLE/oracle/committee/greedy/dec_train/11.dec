in a year , yes .
thanks very much for that .
so , we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group , which is good .
so , we 've got that cross-link .
we also have a director of social services on our programme board and , obviously , they 're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children .
i just made reference to , under the question on specialist camhs in-patients , the need to bring those services together , and that , really , is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the together for children and young people programme and the constituent parts .
so , i 'm confident that that has been pegged now .
we 've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that .
