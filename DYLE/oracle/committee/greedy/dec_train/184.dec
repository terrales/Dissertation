it seems as though having numbers is a difficult challenge for this government .
on march 10 , the deputy minister of veterans affairs committed to providing the veterans affairs committee with an updated , written plan on how the department will resolve this backlog .
this plan was to include timelines .
when will the veterans affairs committee be provided with this plan ?
