thank you .
gareth .
again , probably , i 'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes , because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through philip 's team as well or his welsh government predecessors as regulators , depending on which qualifications they were .
obviously , we need to be spot-on with those .
very occasionally , somebody will identify an error , and obviously we then correct them , because these are available digitally online .
so , if there is a problem , we want to hear about it and then we can correct it .
but , yes , i agree with their fundamental premise , that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts , including , as we mentioned earlier , so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as wjec free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching .
we need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year .
so , the ideal is that everything is there 12 months ahead .
