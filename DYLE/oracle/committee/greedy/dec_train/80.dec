and it 's for the future , not for now .
i was just curious about where you thought the main source would be— okay .
all right , thank you .
the consultation and then the bill going forward has been discussed by cabinet , and gone through cabinet processes , as you would expect .
i started at the very beginning , deputy minister , with the fact that there 's an overwhelming majority of parents—those who are naturally charged with raising their children—against this bill .
so , there is a polarisation .
we 've gone out to survey on it and the overwhelming response from parents is that they do not support this bill .
and i think that needs to be put on the record .
but not from parents .
