i think that 's really broad .
obviously , colleagues in education , colleagues in social care , colleagues in preventative services , but also welsh government and the national assembly , in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really , really key .
if you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run , notably in relation to violence against women , domestic abuse and sexual violence , and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness—i think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness .
we also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness .
we have existing preventative services , we have all our universal services , we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards .
so , there are a number of avenues that we could then explore .
in terms of not wishing to criminalise , i think if we look at the numbers , they are very , very small .
and i think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or is n't likely to happen once or if this bill ever gets to the point of royal assent—they are small numbers who currently use this defence .
it is about that wider issue of awareness raising , and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense .
