we can look at exclusions .
we also have to read across about how the whole system works , not just the pdg element of the system .
so , we know , for example , that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need , so we ca n't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding ; we have to look at it at a wider level of support .
so , given that the majority of those children will have an aln , how can we make sure that our new aln legislation and our new aln regime meets the needs of these children ?
so , i think what we 're looking at , again , is to say that it ca n't be just the job of the pdg .
that 's there as an additional level of support , but actually , we 've got to get our aln right .
unless we get our aln right , lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in , day out via that system .
we do know that sometimes , if we 're not addressing aln , then we 're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance .
so , we 've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting , that are not just as a result of the fact that they 're looked after ; they have other needs as well .
