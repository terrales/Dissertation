and it 's for the future , not for now .
i was just going to say that it 's probably worth saying that looking at how agencies work together will be one of the things , again , that will be looked at very carefully on the task and finish group , looking at processes and procedures .
we 're very alert to the fact that there are different organisations , different services , and that bringing them together , working in as consistent a way as possible , is really , really important .
as the minister has said , social services , the police and others are already committed to working together , and , actually , we just want to make sure that we develop those working practices in the best way possible , recognising that not every area will have a mash , and reiterating , again , what the deputy minister has saidâ€”that the effectiveness of the bill is not predicated on a mash in every area , but it is important that all those organisations do work together in a consistent and appropriate way .
something like that .
