thank you , mr. chair .
obviously , contact tracing is an important part of managing any outbreak .
in fact , we have been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country , including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations .
we are working very closely with them to make sure we have the capacity .
the member is right that many other countries have used digital contact tracing apps .
anything we put forward as a digital tool to assist with contact tracing would be thoroughly considerate of canadians ' privacy rights .
particular attention must be paid to transparency , privacy and ethical concerns .
naturally , canadians are concerned about how their data is used .
new technologies are subject to the privacy act .
