mr. chair , we are very concerned about the safety of our workplaces and we do n't want workers to feel unsafe as they go back to work .
however , we do want people to go back to work .
we are working very closely with the provinces .
the minister of health is working on occupational health and safety guidelines .
the minister of labour is working with her colleagues .
we are taking an all-of-government approach to ensure that workers are safe , that they do n't have to put their lives or the health of their families in jeopardy and that we can support them in these efforts .
but this is about cerb eligibility .
i respect
