okay .
so , it 's got their full confidence .
the school improvement services ?
the four consortia .
well , erw does things differently , but then so does the education achievement service .
eas is constituted in a different way to the central south consortium .
what i 'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised , i 'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers .
erw has got particular challenges , and we continue to work with those in erw to address those , but increasingly , as i said , what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery .
