mr. chair , i want to thank mr. easter , the member for the riding of malpeque on prince edward island .
it 's a beautiful rural riding with lots of agricultural production .
i want to recognize the hard work of farmers throughout the crisis .
on tuesday , i was proud to announce one more step for supporting our producers and processors .
we know the importance of our potato farmers , and that 's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program , a $ 50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories , such as potatoes , to local food organizations .
on the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers , called the business risk management program , we announced up to $ 125 million in funding through agrirecovery and made changes to agristability that will help producers quickly .
i will continue to discuss with my provincial counterparts toenhance and improve the brm programs .
in the meantime , i want to reiterate that brm programs , including agriinvest , are there to help farmers in difficult times .
