well , mr. chair , again there was no specific thank you to taiwan .
the government of taiwan has been the world leader in successfully fighting the covid-19 pandemic .
we have a lot to learn from them and their response .
sadly , the people 's republic of china continues to oppose taiwan 's membership in the world health organization .
will the minister now do the right thing and assure canadians that he will fully support efforts to grant taiwan membership in the world health organization ?
