thank you , mr. chair , and greetings from saanichgulf islands .
the petition i 'm presenting today is petition e-2509 , which has been duly certified .
it relates to what i think many of us will regard as the real heroes of the last few months .
in this pandemic , there have often been very underpaid and overworked front-line workers who receive minimum wage and nothing more , and who are of course deemed essential services .
the petitioners have asked the government to implement a wage supplement as a temporary measure to bring the wages for those who are in contact with the general public and working in what has been deemed an essential service to no less than $ 20 an hour , in light of their service and the risks they 're taking for all of us .
