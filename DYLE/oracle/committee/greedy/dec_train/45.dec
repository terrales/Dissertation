thank you for that openness on the part of the government .
i want more and clear commitments .
we also know that race-based or discriminatory police practices still exist across canada .
will the government commit to working with provinces to ensure there are no such practices allowed to exist in canada , particularly related to discriminatory police practices like carding ?
will the federal government work and use its powers to end those discriminatory practices where federal regulation applies , and work with the provinces to ensure this happens across the country ?
the honourable minister .

mr.martel , you have about a minute left .
