we 've done a great deal of work recently , over recent years , to ensure that that delay between having an english version and a welsh version is reduced .
we are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the welsh and the english are available simultaneously .
in those terms , we 've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we 've named this morning , so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced .
there is a risk there , of course .
the nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind , or edit as he or she is writing .
well , with that model , we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward , chapter by chapter perhaps , so that there would be no changes to be made from then on .
at the end of the process , then , the publishers in england have agreed to hold the english version back for a period of time until the welsh version is available , and then to publish both simultaneously .
unless that timetable is followed throughout the process , there are inherent risks in that process , of course , as i 've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials , and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to .
