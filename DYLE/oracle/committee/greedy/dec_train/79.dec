we 've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents , and i think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen .
but i think we 've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we 've already mentioned , that we 're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more , and that 's where we will identify this .
but that clarity is needed as well .
okay .
all right , thank you .
there has been an in-the-round discussion before the bill was introduced , at which the first minister and the finance minister and others were present .
something like that .
