my advice was not that we do n't need a target—we may well need a target , and that 's one of the issues we need to consult on—but that the target that had been adopted in england and in scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable , and that if we are to choose a target in wales , then we need to balance deliverability with challenge .
we need a challenging environment .
so , there is something about performance management , because i would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they 're delivering on this , and i think we can use targets to that .
but they are one tool in the box that i would think we could use , and part of the consultation is to ask that question—'if we are to go down a route in wales of choosing a target , what might that look like ? '
it is shocking .
