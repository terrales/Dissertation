mr. chair , i would point out that gun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable , and it 's important that governments and communities take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals .
that 's why we do important work at our border to keep guns from being smuggled into our country , but it also necessitates additional work .
i do n't think you can talk about gun violence without talking about stronger gun control .
that 's why our government has taken a very strong position and will strengthen gun control to keep canadians safe .
the leader of the government in the house of commons is asked to keep his answer brief .
