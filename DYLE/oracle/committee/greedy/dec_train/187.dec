and we have to stick to the brexit impact .
darren .
yes , thank you .
we had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions , including cardiff university , and it 's very interesting , in relation to erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that , i think , only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in cardiff is paid for by erasmus+ .
i note that you 've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator .
i was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that .
the brexit clock , yes .
