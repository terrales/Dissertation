i 'd like to thank the member opposite for her excellent point .
our government is very committed to removing barriers to interprovincial trade .
it 's something that we have been working on with the premiers .
obviously the coronavirus has taken precedence in recent weeks , but it 's a priority .
it 's the right thing to do .
mr. chair , it is absolutely right and appropriate for first ministers , who have been meeting every week for more than two months , to be focusing on the urgent threat posed by the coronavirus .
however , i agree with the member opposite that we need to lift barriers to interprovincial trade .
that 's something we 're committed to doing and to working on with the premiers .
