frankly , i 'm surprised that the answer is coming from that minister when the minister of infrastructure and communities is in the house , but i will ask this question .
can the minister tell canadians who pierre lavalle is ?
i thank my colleague for his important question .
what he is describing is the reason we are currently working on a game plan .
we really want to be able to reach these small businesses , of which there are many in saguenaylac-saint-jean , in quebec and across the country .
that is why the prime minister and the minister of finance have committed an additional $ 1billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks .
we need to respond now , and i will have more to say about it in the next few days .
