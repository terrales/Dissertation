i 'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners , we 'll be getting it right for all of our learners .
i gave the example earlier , for instance , of attachment disorder , and , chair , you will know that i have had conversations .
one of the emerging themes for me , as i go around visiting schools , is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder , and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children .
so , for instance , as i said about carmarthenshire , there 's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in carmarthenshire .
now , that has a disproportionate benefit for those children , because you 're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced , because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived , but that does n't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after .
it can be found in other families as well .
so , that vulnerable learner , regardless of their background , will benefit from having teachers who are better trained , understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need .
