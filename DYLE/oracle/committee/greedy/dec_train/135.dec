we continue to stand in solidarity with our allies , including the five eyes , as they have stood in solidarity with canada in terms of the two canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in china .
in the coming months and years , we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic , including questions that are important for china .
at the same time , we are going to work hard to ensure that all canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic .
it was on a point of order this question is for the tourism minister .
the tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis , yet despite the prime minister 's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed canadians who work in tourism , there 's still been nothing from this government .
when will the government finally act to provide help to this nearly crippled industry ?
