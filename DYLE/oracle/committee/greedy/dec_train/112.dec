were you asking about something specific there ?
it does cause one concern , because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector , and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures , we 're talking about half of the schools almost , and no improvement in the teaching quality in general .
so , there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation , and then there 's a new curriculum that comes in .
i see the opportunities , but these schools that are doing well are going to go , 'wow , up there ' , but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools .
is n't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that 's allocated ?
you talked about releasing teachers for training , but perhaps it 's in those particular schools that we need to focus .
