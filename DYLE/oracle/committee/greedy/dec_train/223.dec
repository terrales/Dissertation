mr. chair , i am very happy to explain to the member opposite that we are doing just that .
perhaps he is n't aware of our $ 33 billion infrastructure program in which we are working directly with the government of quebec to build infrastructure that 's making a huge difference , including projects in the member 's riding .
we are going to continue doing that .
mr.chair , the change of management at the canada infrastructure bank marks a new phase in the development of the bank .
we are working to build a modern , public infrastructure , to create jobs , and to make canada more competitive internationally .
