we 've got some more detailed questions now on understanding , from siân gwenllian .
just to drill down rather deeper into the issue of the variability in the way in which the welsh bac is provided , could you explain why you think that this inconsistency is happening , and then what the impact of the inconsistency and variability is on the value that learners attach to the bac and their understanding of it ?
she was n't .
angharad was n't there .
—denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer .
okay .
you can not recognise it , but that is contrary to the evidence that we 've received .
i 'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive , but it actually demonstrates inconsistency .
so , would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the welsh bac as a tool for application ?
