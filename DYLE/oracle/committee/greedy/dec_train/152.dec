well , janet , i understand—and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations—i understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision i had to take to cancel this summer 's exam series .
but i 'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached .
qualifications wales has made it very clear—and for people who would like more information , i would urge them to look at qualifications wales 's website—how they will go about giving , allocating , and awarding a grade to our a-level and gcse students .
firstly , teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained , should they have taken an exam .
and , of course , teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade .
teachers will also be asked to rank students in order .
once that information has been submitted to qualifications wales , there will be a process by which that data will be moderated ; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation , thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being , and remaining , true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system , and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education , where they are looking to move on to the next stages—that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future .
