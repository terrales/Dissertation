do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself has n't been strong enough , and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter , rather than through legislation , and that 's why the strengthening is required ?
i have to say that , at present , we 've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit .
and there are a number of reasons for that .
actually , the current act—the 2015 act—does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses , other than pgce courses for it purposes .
in the case of part-time courses , i 'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the welsh government .
so , i think we are , at this moment , relaxed about that , and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses .
i think what 's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in wales , as a result of our reforms to student finance .
but , clearly , we 'll need to keep that under review .
but , at this current moment , the act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there 's not a pressing policy need that we 've identified to date .
