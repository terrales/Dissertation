so , if i could just make some points on fe .
we 've been actively engaging with the fe sector .
we 've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing .
i think it 's quite a different response than what is going to be happening in he .
you 've got to remember that the fe colleges are much more anchored within their communities , they 're much more localised , and so , for example , the number of eu students in these colleges is significantly lower .
the number of staff in these collegesâ€”i think they 've analysed that there are only about 71 people .
so , we 're keeping in touch with them and we 're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the home office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71. but that's a much bigger issue , i think , for higher education .
but it is a prospect that this would n't be achieved as you foresee .
i was just going to go back to that , yes .
