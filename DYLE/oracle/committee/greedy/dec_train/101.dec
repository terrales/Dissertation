well , one of the questions that are often asked is : could we measure more on a longitudinal basis ?
by that i mean in england , for example , children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11—at age 11 or 12. , that kind of age group .
and so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to children .
i think that would be helpful to us in wales , and it 's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that .
obviously , that would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it .
but it 's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation—the point that was made earlier .
