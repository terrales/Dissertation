mr. chair , i share the member 's deep sadness about the number of lives we 've lost to opioid overdose .
our government has been steadily making it easier for people who live with substance use to access medications to treat substance use , such as prescription suboxone and methadone .
we have made it easier to rapidly establish safe injection sites in communities and have supported community-based projects that work with people who are using substances .
we need to understand that this is a complex issue , and we need to support people to get the help they need .
