i am aware , and we 've listened to stakeholders ' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body .
as i said , we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to estyn and qaa .
so , we 've been listening to that , following the technical consultation , and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission .
as i said , i do n't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation , but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent , need to be effective and need to be comprehensive .
what we 're also very clear about , and i think it is important to say , is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with enqa , which i think is really , really important going forward .
and by an extension of that , it would be compatible with current uk-wide baseline standards .
so , we do n't want to create specific problems for the he sector in wales .
