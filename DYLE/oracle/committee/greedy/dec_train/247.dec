well , it 's not something i wish i could do ; i think that we 're doing it .
self-praise is no recommendation , but , because of the working relationship that we have , i think we 're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes .
so , i 've just talked about living wage ; we 're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders ' pay , the gender pay gap within institutions .
for instance , as part of this government 's commitment to improving mental health , we 've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector .
these are national priorities and we 're acting upon them and we 're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities .
and , i have to say , universities have risen to that challenge , and i 'm very grateful to them for doing that .
