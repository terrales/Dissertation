mr. chair , i can confirm that we have increased the wage subsidies for canada student jobs .
we have added flexibilities , including the ability to have part-time work and the ability to have the jobs extended until february of next year .
that said , the budget was not changed .
it remains at 70,000 job placements for 70,000 students , with 100 % of them being subsidized at 100 % .
