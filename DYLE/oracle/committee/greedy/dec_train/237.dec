those conversations are ongoing with the student loans company .
as i said , we anticipate no disruption toâ€” .
we do n't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this .
individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the student loans company would respond to that .
all i would say is , just to remind people : people who work for the student loans company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else .
there will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery , simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the government .
so , i think we just need to bear that in mind : that these organisations are doing their best , but , if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus , then i hope people will give them due consideration .
we instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease , not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in china and other parts of south-east asia .
and so , as the disease has progressed , we 've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the uk , and i am assured that the universities here in wales have got processes in place that support those learners .
