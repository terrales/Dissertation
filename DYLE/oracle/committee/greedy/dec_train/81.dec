sorry , karen .
yes .
are you satisfied that that amount of money—£2.5 million over five years [ correction : £2.2 million over six years ] —is going to be enough ?
from memory , with the organ donation bill , the amount was something in the region of around £7 million that was set aside , i think .
or maybe i 'm misremembering that , but— i think it was about £4 million—
