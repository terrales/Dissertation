well , we do hope , because we 've had the pledges and commitments from the government , that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding .
so , to what extent does that undermine the current work ?
because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on .
businesses want to know , if they 're starting on some sort of journey , that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line .
that must be undermining a lot of the work that 's going on now .
if there 's not that agreement— —then it will be open to universities to charge market-driven , international rates .
