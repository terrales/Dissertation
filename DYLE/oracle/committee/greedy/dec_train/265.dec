mr. chair , i want to thank the honourable member for that question .
right from the very beginning , we 've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our canadian small businesses .
she 's absolutely right : 98 % of all our businesses in this country are small businesses , so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators .
that is why we have put out significant measures .
for the canada emergency business account , over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support .
i absolutely acknowledge that there is more work to do .
i can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses , all businesses , are supported , whether it is helping keep your employees together , helping with rent support , helping to keep your business 's expenses low , or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time .
