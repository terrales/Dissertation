resourcing will be important .
we currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally , and , of course , obesity and overweight in particular .
so , the question of resourcing is important .
now , we ca n't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what 's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in wales .
a figure of £8 million to £10 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest , but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes .
we need to look at existing programmes , how effective they are .
can we make them more effective ?
can we get better value from them ?
and there may well be a case for new investment , and that 's a question , of course , that would need to be discussed with ministers when we 're producing the final strategy .
