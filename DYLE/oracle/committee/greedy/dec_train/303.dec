thank you .
julie .
that funding was allocated , as i said , to enable hefcw to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes , because we 've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds , and the initial implications of eu transition .
it was allocated as part of hefcw 's overall grant in aid , and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector .
the money was brought forward a year , because , in conversations with hefcw and the institutions , they felt that that money would be more useful earlier on .
so , it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18 , as opposed to 2018-19 , because they wanted to have that resource earlier rather than later .
with regard to additional resources , you 'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of £5 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees , and £5 million has been made available to hefcw to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we 're in a position to fully implement diamond at the postgraduate level .
