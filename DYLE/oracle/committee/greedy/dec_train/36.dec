okay , thank you .
julie .
we are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years .
as i 've said , we 're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings , and we 're already developing that .
but estyn and ciw will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards , and , since january 2019 , ciw and estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase .
so , that is a very positive move , i think , and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained , because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings , that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained .
so , we have got the system of inspection to ensure that .
because that was one of the key drivers for that as well .
it 's in the process at the moment .
