llyr , in the absence of anything better .
i 'll be the first person to say that maybe it 's not as absolutely focused , but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need , i think it 's probably the best that we 've got at present .
and we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways .
we have to be mindful .
some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands , so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit , for instance , we 've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need , going forward .
we have n't had any additional resource as a result of this , but we 're very mindful that , potentially , this has an impact , going forward .
and , officials are working all of the time , i must say , in conjunction with the department in england , to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward , but before i make any decisions , i want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that .
