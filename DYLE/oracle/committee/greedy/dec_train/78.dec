i think the healthy child wales programme and the role of the health visitor is absolutely crucial , because , obviously , the health visitor is there right at the beginning .
it 's a universal service , and so there will be great opportunity for them to promote positive parenting in a much stronger way than they 're able to do at the moment , because the fact that you have this defence does mean that the professionals are n't able to make it as clear as they want to make it that positive parenting is the way that they 'd like families to go .
so , i think this will be a great advantage to health visitors , and , obviously , they support it strongly , because they 're trying to encourage parents not to use physical punishment now , but with their hands slightly tied behind their back , because the defence does exist .
okay .
and who were the discussions with ?
okay .
did you want to come in ?
