we think this is very important , and we 're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in welsh or bilingual settings , so we think that 's very good .
we have established a specific programme to develop welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the national centre for learning welsh , to develop workplace welsh language skills across the sector .
so , we 're actually working with that , and i think you 've done something with those recently , have n't you ?
i do n't know if you want toâ€” okay .
and it 's ingrained in the early years training .
