it 's great that you 're on that group , but what does it actually do ?
that 's the bit i was n't sure about .
clearly , we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the eu and from around the world .
the fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on european union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that wales , up until now , has been successful in recruiting international students .
so , the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students , because , actually , international students outside of the eu make up a bigger proportion of students not from the uk who come to our institutions .
i think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and , of course , that money is now not available for the next financial year , so there 's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it , presumably .
and will this money be used equally between all the universities ?
