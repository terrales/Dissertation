thank you .
darren millar .
this is a huge mess , is n't it ?
it 's a huge mess , which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers , lots of pressure and extra work for learners , and is affecting the well-being of students , at a time when they need to be mentally fit , in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up .
we know that the problems are not confined to welsh-medium resources ; they 're also being experienced in english language resources as well , particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks .
you 've both mentionedâ€”both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers , and i would agree with you on that front .
but is n't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody 's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn , and swot up on , in advance of exams ?
mr blaker , you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification .
it would be possible .
