on a uk level .
thank you , chair .
you make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education .
what would that look like ?

okay .
and finally , with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools , do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils ?
