on a uk level .
sure , because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway .
of itself , it would n't address the problem , but , added to other initiatives , i guess it would .
can i just ask you briefly , then , about community sport infrastructure and , in particular , of new schools ?
so , welsh government , as you know , has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme .
what we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently , particularly headteachers , was that , in some of the new schools that have been built , we have n't had changing rooms and toilet facilities , for instance , built into the new buildings .
so , if we 're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public , actually , more active , do you think that 's something that we ought to be building in ?
again , not your particular direct area of responsibility , but something that you might have an input into , is that , when we 're developing schools , we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public .
is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around ?
