you 're absolutely correct , chair .
officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children 's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time .
we are fortunate in the regard that , because of previous decisions and investments , we have a strong base on which to build because we have our hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of microsoft office and google for education tools , which are available to all families .
we have become the first , i think—we 're certainly the first in the uk , and i 'm not sure whether we 're the first across the world , but i think we probably are—to deploy , for instance , adobe spark nationally .
but , obviously , access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time .
officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time .
