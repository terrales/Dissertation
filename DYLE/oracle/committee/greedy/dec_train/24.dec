it was set up , actually , about 18 months ago—just under .
it was set up to build collective efficacy , because what people out there are seeing is that there 's a confusion of roles , in what the regions are doing , and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel .
so , they 've been looking at who is doing what for the last 18 months , and exploring and making some changes themselves .
it 's not just what they do with government or what they do with each other ; it 's just happened that it 's timely , because one of the key bits of feedback we believe we will get from the organisation for economic co-operation and development is we have had co-construction , we 'd had collective effort , but we need to do more , particularly within the middle tier .
this is not controlled by government , it is arm 's length from government , and it 's not their job to get it ready for the new curriculum—that 's a key part of it .
this group will have an ongoing role ; it 's not a task and finish group .
it does feed back in to the minister but there 's no formal mechanism by which they have to report .
