darren—is it on this ?
okay , mark ?
if we move on at this stage—i wonder , before other members come in , if i could ask about community-focused schools .
quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education , and one way of doing that , i think , is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community , linked well with outside organisations , having an extended school-day offer .
we have the twenty-first century schools programme , but we have a lot of schools existing that have n't been part of that .
i just wondered to what extent estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across wales , because i think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent .
