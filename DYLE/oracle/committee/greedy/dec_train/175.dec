thank you .
darren millar .
i just want to ask about this eight-week delay .
so , you ’ re telling us , mr ebbsworth , that the wjec has agreed with hodder and illuminate that , in future , even if an english textbook is available for publication , and it ’ s already late , you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the welsh-medium textbook ?
okay .
john .
it would be possible .
