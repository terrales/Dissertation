as the cabinet secretary mentioned , the higher education brexit working group's been meeting since september 2016 and has been looking at that in general .
more recently , when the prospect of no deal became talked about , officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that .
as you 'll be aware , the funding for much of the activity is secured , we believe , even under a 'no deal ' scenario , until december 2020 ; that 's a letter we had from the chief secretary to the treasury .
i think the research you 're referring to may be research that cardiff university has been doing with the bevan foundation and others .
i know there 's a report due to be launched later today .
we have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on he , fe and apprenticeship providers .
but it is a prospect that this would n't be achieved as you foresee .
