we 've touched on contingency plans , but , in an environment of uncertainty , i think it 's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is .
i think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios , what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding .
so , we touched on strengthening the global wales engagement in order to sell wales , so more focus on marketing wales overseas , but also within the uk .
the other area where the sector is working at a uk level very hard is making the arguments to uk government for maintaining access to the successor to horizon 2020 , which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructureâ€”students is one part , but the whole funding infrastructure for maintaining research capacity .
so , working with uk universities to make arguments at uk government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions are doing .
we mentioned the welsh government 's he brexit group .
that group , which is the welsh government group , is being advised by members on it , and that 's informing welsh government officials when they engage with uk government as well .
