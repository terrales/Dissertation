thank you very much , siÃ¢n .
as you quite rightly say , on average , we have 518 school hubs open each day , with up to 4,200 children attending .
we have seen an increase in the number of attendances since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term .
we have approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs , and at present , 85 per cent of the children who are attending are the children of key workers , the remainder being vulnerable children .
so , we are now averaging 600 vulnerable children per day .
these are small numbers , but we have seen an increase in those numbers since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term .
