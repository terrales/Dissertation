as you 'll be aware , the funding for much of the activity is secured , we believe , even under a 'no deal ' scenario , until december 2020 ; that 's a letter we had from the chief secretary to the treasury .
i think the research you 're referring to may be research that cardiff university has been doing with the bevan foundation and others .
i know there 's a report due to be launched later today .

the financial allocation , as i said , was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues , but if you 'd like further details i can provide those as much as i 'm able .
