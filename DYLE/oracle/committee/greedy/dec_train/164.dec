mr.chair , canadians know that the government is there to support them .
eight i thank the hon .
member for her question .
we know this pandemic has deeply affected the lives and health of all canadians and has disproportionately affected canadians with disabilities in particular .
from the very beginning , we 've taken a disability-inclusive approach to our emergency response to ensure that canadians with disabilities get the support they need .
that is why we announced a one-time payment of $ 600 for persons with disabilities to address these expenses .
this will go a long way toward helping canadians with disabilities .
we encourage and urge all parties in the opposition to support this measure .
we 're confident that this measure , along with other investments , will benefit canadians with disabilities , and we hope to get the support of the other parties very soon .
