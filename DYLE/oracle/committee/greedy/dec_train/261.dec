that 's not a point of order .
mr. chair , as you know , the government has been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all canadians .
the pmprb regulatory amendments will help canadians be able to afford their prescriptions , and canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines .
in fact , many countries with much lower medicine prices gained access to new medicines in the same time frame as canada frame , or even faster , so we are excited to do this work .
