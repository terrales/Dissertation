of course .
in the accreditation process , which has not been without its pain , and some significant decisions made in that regard , the criteria for the ite programmes note that , and i 'm going to quote it : 'teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning , bringing together different aspects to examine , for example , important topics such as citizenship , enterprise , financial capability and sustainability . '
so , the prime driver for our ite reforms , obviously , is the preparedness for 'successful futures ' , but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that , those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the welsh baccalaureate .
so , it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ite providers will have to deliverâ€”ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that , as i said , ensures that we successfully deliver on donaldson , but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the welsh bac .
