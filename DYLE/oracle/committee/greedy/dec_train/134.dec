firstly , can i say it 's absolutely crucial that we track performance , absolutely crucial ?
that 's the bedrock .
we do n't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school .
there are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this , but we are absolutely clear , and best practice and evidence shows us , that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial .
and , as i said in the beginning , where we were n't tracking pupils at all , initial investment in pdg was used to establish these systems within schools .
again , one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review , and one of the lessons learnt , was , again , the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career .
but we do n't dictate a single system .
