the money that is available is going via consortia to schools .
individual schools are best placed to understand the professional learning needs of their staff .
and if that school understands that they have particular professional learning needs for the welsh baccalaureate , then i would expect the money to be spent on that .
where a school is doing the welsh baccalaureate particularly well , then the school might identify other areas where they look to seek improvement .
therefore , it is for the individual school to assess the professional learning needs of their staff .
we ca n't second-guess that , and therefore it has to be right that school leaders are able to plan the professional learning of their staff accordingly .
