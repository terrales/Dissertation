thank you very much , mr. chair .
of course , our priority is and always has been and always must be the protection of the health and safety of canadians .
that 's why we put in place these restrictions for non-essential travel and have required , through the public health agency of canada , a 14-day quarantine .
i do n't know the specifics of the person for whom you advocate , but we want to make sure that if they come into canada , it is for an essential purpose and that they do it safely and respect the quarantine that has been put in place .
