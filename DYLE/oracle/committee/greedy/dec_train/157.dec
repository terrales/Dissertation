mr.chair , i am glad to see that there is recognition of the importance of transferring this money .
my question is whether it can be transferred unconditionally ; that 's what i 'm asking .
there 's a state of emergency .
in the past , we have seen that it takes a long time to negotiate conditions with the federal government .
we saw it in the case of the quebec city tramway , and we are still seeing it now in the case of transfers for housing in quebec , for which there is no agreement and , therefore , no transfer of money .
will the federal government send the money free of conditions ?
we now return to ms.normandin .
