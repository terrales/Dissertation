i think there is a fairly clear good news story here .
pisa shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed , i think , to the new gcse mathematics numeracy .
i think there 's much less predictability in that work ; you ca n't approach it in a formulaic way , either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it .
there 's much more problem solving .
it 's about applying what you 've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum .
i think that that gcse numeracy has built on the work that 's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework , which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation .
that has been a really good news story , really .
they 're not the same .
