okay .
that 's great , thank you .
can i just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools , which i 've just mentioned previously , and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well ?
because we 're in a situation where a number of primary schools have got surplus funds , sometimes that 's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up , but there is a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit and that , overall , secondary schools are in deficit .
is there a correlation between those two positions , that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools ?
yes , it is .
