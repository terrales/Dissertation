thank you , mr. chair .
by its own numbers , pspc has had to cut the number of n95 masks the government has on order after cancelling contracts with companies that were not able to meet canadian standards .
we know that companies right here in canada were willing to step up and fill in the gap .
will the minister commit to making domestic production of ppe , including n95 masks , a priority ?
mr. chair , our priority is to make sure that we get safe and effective equipment and supplies into the hands of front-line health care workers .
we 've been running multiple complementary supply chains at the same time .
building up domestic capacity is indeed a priority .
we have a contract with medicom in montreal for the production of n95 masks and we will continue to work hard to ensure we 'll now go to mr. epp , the member for chatham-kentleamington .
