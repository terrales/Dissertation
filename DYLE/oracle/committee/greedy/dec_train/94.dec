or prevention .
i do n't know whether that is necessaryâ€”i 'm not a legislator .
i think that there 's obviously an inherent interest in welsh government raising awareness , because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful , otherwise we will have parents who feel that they 're being criminalised , and that 's the last thing we want .
i think it 's worthy of consideration , but , as i say , i 'm not a legislator or a lawyer , so i do n't know what implications that will have long term .
but to be fair to welsh government , i think that commitment is one that i 'm sure will be honoured , because welsh government will want to make a success of this bill if it does receive royal assent .
and then they can be added into this .
