—or are you still thinking about it ?
that 's a very hefcw thing to say .
thank you , chair .
i think , in terms of the levels of measures—and i understand what you 're saying—but i think what hefcw were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector—just 10 institutions to work with .
the post-16 sector , however many we 're talking—50 plus providers—it 's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions .
so , the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently , possibly .
okay .
those were the words used by universities wales— dawn .
