it was only three words .
no , not at all .
i think they are very , very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other , as to what they can expect from their partners in the middle tier .
and absolutely , it is about making sure that there is n't duplication , that people are n't second-guessing each other 's work , and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system , and , as i said , knowing that you can rely on your colleague in the middle tier to do the bit that they are responsible for .
so , i do n't think there 's a question of it losing focus .
