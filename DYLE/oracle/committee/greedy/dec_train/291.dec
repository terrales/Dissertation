meilyr rowlands , chief inspector .
it is to do with the ethos and the culture of the school .
yes , it is on this .
i was just wondering— .
i mean , one of the problems that i know you 've identified in the past is this lack of good practice being able to travel into all parts of wales , and , of course , we 've got local authorities , we 've got regional consortia , we 've got the welsh government—all of which want to see good practice replicated where possible .
what opportunities are there , perhaps , to develop some other further opportunities for good practice to be shared and promoted ?
i know that the wales audit office , for example , has its good practice exchange .
is there something similar that schools can engage with to make things happen ?
