the honourable minister .
mr. chair , the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and wo n't protect workers ' and pensioners ' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits .
the government can protect severance , termination pay , pensions and benefits from corporate theft , but will they do it , yes or no ?
