well , you 're absolutely right .
as we often say in this committee , universities are autonomous institutionsâ€”a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question .
universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them .
colleges are in a similar position , looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods , and the bill , potentially , does give us more powers of intervention in both the fe and the he sector .
