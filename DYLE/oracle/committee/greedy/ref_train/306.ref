while talking about the official commitments to help the wales universities to get through the transition period , suzy davies compared the two kinds of multi-annual commitments that one was related to revenue and the other to capital .
she did not think that either of them would work , however , according to eluned morgan , the official commitment related to capital would matter more under such a transition period .
even if most people would focus on the revenue , they should pay attention to the capital for that it is exactly the capital that ensured the institutions to operate well under the dilemma .
