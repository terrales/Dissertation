while it was imperative that the public were made aware of this controversial change in the law , she thought the deputy minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1. for example , amendment 1a changed amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law .
amendment 1b stated that there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when discipline their children , which she thought was very important to parents .
amendment 1c explained that the welsh government should ensure clear advice was provided on what people could do if they had seen a child being physically assaulted , and this could help raise public awareness of how they could report and in what situations they could report .
