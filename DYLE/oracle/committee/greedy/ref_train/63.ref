the deputy minister proposed that she encouraged members to reject amendment 3a .
she said she was not seeking to add any new powers to the bill .
amendment 3 would simply add the existing power back onto the face of the bill , where amendments 7 and 8 remove it , and amendment 6 would bring the power into force the day after royal assent .
then suzy davies said that amendment 3a was a holding position , and they would return this to the deputy minister in stage 3. suzy thought this was an area where it might be valuable to discuss quite what kind of powers they were looking for , because suzy davies thought the deputy minister might need something that was beyond transitional , transitory and saving .
at last , they took a vote for this and ended up with rejecting amendment 3a , and agreeing on amendment 3 .
