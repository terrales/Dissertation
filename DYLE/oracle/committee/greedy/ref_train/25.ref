in kirsty 's opinion , it appeared that it was placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system .
however , there was not a risk from them to lose focus .
absolutely , it was about making sure that there was no duplication , that people were not second-guessing each other 's work .
there were clear demarcations about who does what in the system .
therefore , there was not a question of losing focus .
