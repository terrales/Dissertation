some of the schools challenge cymru schools are making sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end .
like the example of tredegar , where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system .
the challenge is for those schools that schools challenge cymru did n't work for , and they have n't seen the progress of how to use the school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools .
so now the focus is a whole-system approach , rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support .
schools challenge cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have .
