according to kirsty , this was a really worrying time for children and young people .
for schools and institutions , they had the formal nhs counselling services to the check-ins .
they were concerned that for some children , their access to their counselling was via their school .
they knew that and they were just double checking the capacity of online counseling that already existed - online counselling tools that children already used because they did not want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor .
