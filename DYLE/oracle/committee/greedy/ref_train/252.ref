kirsty williams am first admitted that it was true that the bill did not directly address issues around governance in the sector .
however , establishing a more direct relationship with chairs of universities , especially one-to-one relationships with them , had been attached much importance and it was crucial to help the government understand each aspect of issues in universities .
moreover , ways to make sure that the governing bodies were diverse and it was able to include both student voice as well as the staff voice in governance going forward would be discussed in the future .
kirsty williams am stressed that there were plans to engage with each of the governing bodies since the situation was getting far more complex .
