when it comes to the governmental issues , some of the members , for example , justin trudeau and jagmeet singh had a heated debate over the way of the distribution of the fund .
the root of their debate was the problem of systematic racism in the rcmp , and many other institutions at home .
therefore , a revolution might be needed in those institutions .
in terms of the revolution , jagmeet singh pointed out that the governmental fund should be allocated to medical care instead of rcmp , for that during the outbreak of covid-19 , emergent needs had shown in the medical field .
