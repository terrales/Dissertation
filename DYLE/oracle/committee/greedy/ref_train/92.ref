the first question was about how they should make it clear that the legislation is not trying to criminalize parents , and who should be responsible for this .
sally jenkins responded that those drivers in relation to that awareness raising should be the key .
there were a lot of ways for this including preventative services , universal services and etc .
then they had some discussions on whether the awareness raising should be on the face of the bill and who should pay for this .
huw david was not sure whether being on the bill was necessary , but he said it was worth consideration .
welsh government ministers should have a duty on this .
