janet finch-saunders am asked about how a-level and gcse would be awarded in alignment with qualifications wales and kirsty williams am explained that to cancel this summer 's exam series was the only clear decision although it was devastating for both students and teachers .
currently , to grade the performance , teachers would first be asked to submit a grade they believed that the student would have obtained , should they have taken an exam .
and teachers would have a range of data and their own professional judgment when grading .
once that information had been submitted to qualifications wales , there would be a process by which that data would be moderated ; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation .
