the most awareness around pdg is around free school meals , and there is less awareness around the availability of pdg to support looked-after children .
in the nature of the cohort , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after .
the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously , so the looked-after pdg is held at a regional level .
