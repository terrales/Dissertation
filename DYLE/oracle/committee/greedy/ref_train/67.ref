janet finch-saunders said that there were ongoing concerns about the potential costs for welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment .
while amendment 11 referred to costs borne by local authorities and health boards , janet finch-saunders had noted that amendment 12 took this further by including other devolved authorities that were not funded by welsh government .
janet finch-saunders wanted these amendments because she genuinely did not believe that they had even envisioned what or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organizations , and certainly their local authorities and health boards , and the impact the bill was going to have .
