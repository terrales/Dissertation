the biggest is that there 's an issue about investment .
the quality of the research base in welsh universities and the productivity of that welsh research base are both good , there 's just not enough of them .
if they want to be able to play into the uk-wide research funding , the investment has two dimensions .
one is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects ; and the second thing is that , compared to uk-wide research pots , wales ' core research funding is not competitive .
also , the welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils .
