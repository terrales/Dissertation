according to kirsty , all exams were cancelled , but year 11 and 13 would be given a grade .
that was because those years and those grades were gateway qualifications , and they were points of movement in the education system .
therefore , it was really important for those students that they were not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they would do next .
actually , they could make sure that their standards were maintained by actually having that modulation across that uk .
so , the children could have real confidence .
