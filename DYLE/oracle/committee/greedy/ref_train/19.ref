in hefin 's opinion , they took erw as an example because it did things differently with regard to the four consortia .
they were interested in the effectiveness of that organization to deliver for children and for teachers since erw had got particular challenges .
what they were seeing the national consortia do is developing a national approach to school improvement services .
what 's more , according to hefin , the regional consortia were not a beast of the government ; they were a beast of the local authorities that had worked together to create a school improvement service that met their needs .
