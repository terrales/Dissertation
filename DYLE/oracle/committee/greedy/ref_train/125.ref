over the period of the last inspection report , they have seen improvements in attendance , but still need to look at again how pdg can support this particular agenda .
there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this , some schools send the staff out and create walking buses , so that they walk the children into the school .
despite these good measures , there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils .
it gets more challenging the older the children get .
