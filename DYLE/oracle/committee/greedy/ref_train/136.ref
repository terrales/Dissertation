the chair brought the meeting to order , announcing that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss covid-19 's impact on canada .
five petitions were presented : to recognize indeginous languages as official languages of canada , to improve the organ donation system , to push for a made-in-canada green economy , to decriminalize drug possession to improve public health , and to protect firearm ownership of law-abiding firearm owners .
mr. pierre paul-hus suggested that the government should not try to pass gun-control legislation or release prisoners during the pandemic .
the prime minister disagreed , claiming that both passing gun-control and releasing imprisoned canadians who did not pose a threat to society advanced the safety of canadians .
