as a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a welsh minister to make an order for commencement , the power to make transitory , transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the bill coming into force would also be removed .
amendment 2 would add the existing power back onto the face of the bill where amendments 7 and 8 removed it , and amendment 6 would bring the power into force the day after royal assent .
these amendments were technical in nature and while she acknowledged that the constitutional and legislative affairs committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied , their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied .
the absence of an assembly procedure did not mean that ministers ' decisions in relation to transitional powers can not be scrutinized by the assembly .
in conclusion , she encouraged members to reject amendment 3a .
