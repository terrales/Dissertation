kirsty williams am first explained that it was a bit difficult to put herself in the position of the former minister but it was clear that it should not be intended .
however , she explained that the act was built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 act , which required hefcw to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions .
so , as a consequence of that approach , hefcw 's quality assessment duty currently encompassesed all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution .
huw morris also helped to explain that a lot of joint operation was required during the process and the new bill would try to make that clearer .
