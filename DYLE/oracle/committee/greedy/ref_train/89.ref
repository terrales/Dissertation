there were totally two questions proposed on impact on education .
first , jayne bryant asked how confident they were that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this bill .
alastair birch responded that training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear .
the awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there .
the second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services , which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust .
alastair birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust .
he thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child , they were under a duty to report that to social care .
