currently , there were two issues regarding the 50 % commercial rent assistance subsidy , where landlords paid 25 % , the government paid 50 % , and the tenant was responsible for 25 % .
the government had been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners , who in turn would lower the rent of their tenants by 75 % .
the government would continue to monitor how this program was delivered .
