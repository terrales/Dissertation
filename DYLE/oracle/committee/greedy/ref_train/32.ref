the welsh and uk governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents , which was a mistake and should be more universally available .
the demand-driven approach was based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way .
it was hard for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds and age groups ?
next , some areas had traditionally got more childcare anyway because they had traditionally more demand in those areas , so there was not a level playing field to start from .
