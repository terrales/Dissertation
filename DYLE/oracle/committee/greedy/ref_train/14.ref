according to kirsty , there were a variety of ways in which schools that needed support or needed to be challenged on their practice would be identified .
basically , they relied on the school categorization system .
what 's more , in kirsty 's opinion , the school improvement service was a risk-based approach .
luckily , the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation .
it would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards .
what they needed now was a more strategic , longer term approach to reach changes in a school rather than some of the easy-to-fix items that made a school as if it was doing better .
