according to kirsty and huw , the real question was how was it that they did n't identify those schools .
since these schools were not being identified early enough , there was a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools .
even though they had identified them as needing that extra help , they were not moving at pace away from that system .
in steve 's opinion , the importance lied on `` what about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? ''
and it brought together what they knew from estyn , but also , local authorities had knowledge of their schools , and so did consortia .
they had got to be better at bringing those together .
