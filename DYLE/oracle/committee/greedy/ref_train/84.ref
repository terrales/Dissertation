huw david thought if this bill was implemented carefully with the right resources , there might not be unintended consequences .
however , for every piece of legislation , it would be about the implementation and the cultural change .
currently , the number of looked-after children in wales were growing a lot , and this was because of the most appalling neglect and abuse .
huw david did not want this focus to be lost .
