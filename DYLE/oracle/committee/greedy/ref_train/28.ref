the real question was not about communicating the data , but about challenging people on how the data should be used .
the data was still available , but it was a challenge to them about how to use the data .
sometimes , how they presented data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of the system .
therefore , it was about how they used the data .
the focus shall be on the more intelligent use and interrogation of the data , and about truly what it was telling us about the system .
