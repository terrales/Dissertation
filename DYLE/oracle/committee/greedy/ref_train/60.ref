the deputy minister firstly expressed her opinions .
she thought amendment 2c would require welsh ministers to prepare and lay before the assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 was commenced , and she thought this was unnecessary and was in conflict with what she thought was a priority for the implementation of this bill .
she also thought this amendment was not required because they were preparing to assess the effectiveness of the awareness raising .
then janet finch-saunder expressed her opinion , and spoke to amendments 2c excluding 2d to 2k .
after this , suzy davies proposed several opinions against the deputy minister .
in specific , suzy davies did not think the amendment should affect the commencement date at all , to respond to the comments the deputy minister made for amendment 2c .
at last , they took a vote and ended up with losing 2c - 2k , and accepting amendment 2 .
