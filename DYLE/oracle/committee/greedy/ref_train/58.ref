her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on welsh ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law .
she had already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over about six years from royal assent if the bill passed .
she thought amendments 1a to 1e which relate to the duty to raise awareness were not necessary .
in specific , amendment 1a was open-ended on promoting public awareness .
all the raised points would be considered by another group , but she thought the level of the detail on the face of the bill was not needed , and same reasons for amendment 1b and 1d .
as for the amendment 1c which was about how to raise concerns , the deputy minister thought the safeguarding was everybody 's business .
in conclusion , she asked for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and asked to reject amendments 1a to 1e , as those were unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needed to achieve .
