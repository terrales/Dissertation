kirsty williams am mentioned that those children would have currently been receiving school counselling , and there would be more children receiving support .
in this case , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families with intense need .
moreover , how to adapt patterns to deliver these services to the pandemic situation would be discussed .
for instance , video or telephone methods would be adopted and one to one basis help patterns would also be included to support professional learning for counsellings .
