this discussion started with janet finch-saunders and janet finch-saunders spoke to both amendments in this group .
she said the reason she wanted these two amendments be there because she genuinely did not believe that the deputy minister had envisioned what or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organizations , and certainly their local authorities and health boards and impact of the bill was going to have .
then the deputy minister responded to this .
she said they had done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of the bill before introduction .
she thought all the evidence had shown that they did not anticipate that there would be a huge increase of a demand for funding , so she encouraged members to reject these amendments , which she thought were not necessary .
at last , they took a vote on amendments 11 and 12 , and ended up with rejecting amendments 11 and 12 , and agreeing with amendment 4 and 5 .
