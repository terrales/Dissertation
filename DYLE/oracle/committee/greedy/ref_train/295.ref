the meeting was about the fiscal and social influence of brexit , especially focusing on the wales education system .
the group was worrying that brexit would cut down the support from the eu to the uk , thus putting the wales universities in great dilemma .
besides , the fact was that the less fiscal support from the eu , the less foreign students would apply for the wales universities .
the members talked about several possible solutions , for instance , adjusting the syllabus to better meet both the students ' and the lecturers ' needs and providing them with better career prospects .
what also mattered was the immigration policy which would be alluring to the foreign students if being reconsidered carefully .
