the group laid their stress on mainly three aspects in terms of dealing with the problem at an official level , which respectively were adding more funding to the universities , implementing a new immigration policy , and asking for the minister 's help .
with adequate funding , the institutions would be more likely to satisfy the research needs from the students .
similarly , a more robust immigration policy might make it more appealing for those who would like to set down in wales .
last but not least , making the minister be aware of the serious problem would also be important that the problem would then be brought to national meetings and discussed by more officials .
