as identified by estyn , most schools are using this money to good effect .
when pdg first started , in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking children , because they had never thought about tracking these children , they did n't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children and to have a system in place .
now they have moved from spending money on the infrastructure around support for fsm children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning .
and they have appointed regional pdg advisers to better deploy the fund .
