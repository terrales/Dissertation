mr. taylor bachrach introduced that municipalities were unable to run deficits and so they were facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that canadians depend on .
currently , the federation of canadian municipalities and mayors across canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector .
since they were very vital to the recovery of the cities under the covid-19 situation , the government was working with the provinces and the cities , to ensure that it was able to support this order of government that could deliver the vast majority of services to canadians with very little financial means .
