there was a debate of whether amendment 1 and 4 , and 1a to 1e should be accepted or rejected .
the deputy minister firstly expressed her opinions .
she was in favor of amendments 1 and 4 , but against 1a to 1e , mainly because she thought that level of details were not necessarily on the face of the bill .
however , janet finch-saunders thought the deputy minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 and explained one by one from 1a to 1e why those amendments were important .
afterwards , there was a short debate about whether to accept those amendments from suzy davies , dawn bowden , hefin david and sian gwenllian .
suzy davies supported amendment 1a to 1e , while others all against them .
at last , they took a vote and it ended up with rejecting amendment 1a to 1e and agreeing with amendment 1 .
