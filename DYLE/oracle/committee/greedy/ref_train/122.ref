according to kirsty williams , when it comes to individual interventions , those individual interventions of pdg should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals ; but in some cases , schools may use their pdg funding to provide a universal intervention .

there are some other ways to drive the potential of talented and able children , like the example of `` a window on the world bus '' paid for by schools .
