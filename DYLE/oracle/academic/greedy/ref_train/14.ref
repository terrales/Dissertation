the group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer .
anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e .
aurora and ti-digits .
the group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of meeting recorder digits or switchboard data .
pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed .
finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the sri recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths .
