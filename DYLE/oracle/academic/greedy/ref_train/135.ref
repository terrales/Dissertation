the meeting took place close to the finalization of the model , so participants were focused on further experimentation they could conduct .
it began with a discussion about how the backend system could be further improved .
the team thought that perhaps they could tweak language scaling and insertion penalties to see how the model changed its performance .
then , the team moved into discussing methods for detecting voice segments in their results .
finally , the team spent some time exploring normalization techniques and acoustic events , both of which could potentially improve model performance .
