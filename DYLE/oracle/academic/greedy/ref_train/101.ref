transcription checking procedures have been formalized , including a spell check , producing an exhaustive list of forms identified in the data , attributing every utterance to the appropriate speaker id , glossing spoken forms with their full orthographic counterparts , e.g .
'cuz ' and 'because ' , transcribing acronyms , and encoding comments , i.e .
glosses , vocalic and non-vocalic non-speech events , pragmatic cues , and the standardization of spoken forms , e.g .
'mm-hmm ' .
