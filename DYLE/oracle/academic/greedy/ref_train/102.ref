the meeting discussed various topics such as data collection and updates on the german parser .
they discussed xml modifications and future thoughts on the ontology .
additionally , object representations will include an eva vector .
this can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type .
the actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities .
in any case , further to fulfilling the basic requirements ( translating the parser and the generator into english ) , the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research .
