the group discussed the current state of their work , which was coming close to a conclusion .
they were putting together their final model , including the various techniques they had explored .
their performance on the aurora tasks was second and very close to those in first place .
the professor thought that further tweaking and incorporation of a neural network would improve their scores .
the team discussed which method to use for noise suppression , which had not been decided yet .
they also delved into a more detailed discussion of the vad and latency .
their method for noise estimation would add a notable delay to the model .
finally , the team delved further into how to finish up the model .
