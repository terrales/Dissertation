the team was setting up a new project in which they would record meetings and then generate summaries .
the meeting began with introductions and a discussion of what kind of data the team could collect .
they considered collecting visual data as well as notes .
at the end of the meetings , the team wanted to ask participants to summarize what they took away as well as ask questions about the meeting .
this would be a method for collecting more data to train a potential summarization model .
one concern the team had was how they could reduce bias when collecting queries .
words like `` important '' could skew participant responses .
the team also expressed some interest in collecting action items .
finally , the team discussed what each member should do to get the project up and running and the role of diversity in their data set .
