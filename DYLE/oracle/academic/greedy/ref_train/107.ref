the meeting occurred close to the finalization of the model for aurora .
the team had put together a model and was tweaking it to see what achieves best performance .
the professor suggested that it was time to make some decisions , have several constants , and then test other theories on remaining features .
the neural net , for instance , was yet to come together .
still , the model was second in ranking for the task , behind the leader by only one point .
the evaluation criteria for the tasks was still not completely clear , but the team seemed to be doing well .
