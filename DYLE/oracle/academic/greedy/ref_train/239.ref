the meeting included an introduction to the project , the mechanics of training the data , standardizing the data for the models , the time involved , and planning efficient use of computational resources .
the team members shared and discussed the existing model as well as the tests they intended to run .
there was a problem standardizing labels as well as converting htk labels to the format that the team wanted .
adding more dimensions to the current model was also causing concern because of the upper bound on computational resources .
