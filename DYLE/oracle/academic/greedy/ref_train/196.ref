phd a thought that a good vad could not be made without baseline features .
on-line normalization was not helping the model when spectral subtraction was already in play .
the short filters were performing as well as the long ones , and the model was doing well on the well-matched case .
despite mixed results , the shorter latency was a positive sign .
