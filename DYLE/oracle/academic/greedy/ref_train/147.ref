the main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by ibm .
the results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling .
regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by ibm , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them .
suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing .
