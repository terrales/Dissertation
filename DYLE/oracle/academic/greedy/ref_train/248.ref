grad c introduced the topic and explained that the new idea was to allow subjects to generate high level tasks , like going shopping , by themselves .
subjects would also be provided a high level schematic which would give them basic features of the environment .
though , the schematic would not contain detailed information , like a street map , which would be reserved for interactions with the wizard .
an instructor would be hired to help subjects navigate the high level tasks .
