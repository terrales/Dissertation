meeting participants began by going over the logistics of recruiting participants , particularly through departmental mailing lists .
they then moved onto discussing a new role , the instructor , who would help experimental participants figure out their intentions .
this would eliminate a pre-written set of goals for the participants .
participants also discussed how the schema would incorporate other information , like choosing movies , and how more complex actions , like that of purchasing goods , could be incorporated into the source-path-goal schema .
finally , the participants concluded that an spg schema of a different kind , one that can transfer previously acquired information , may be more helpful .
the meeting concluded with the discussion of a new meeting time .
