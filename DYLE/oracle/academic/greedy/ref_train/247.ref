the new system for collecting subject intention focused on allowing subjects to come up with the intent themselves .
instead of giving them a list of goals , the subjects would , with the help of an instructor , figure out what they want to do in the environment .
the earlier interaction with the instructor would give them a sense of how specific their goals in the environment could be .
another idea was to use pictures for people to help determine their intention , but the manufacturing of pictures seemed to be a very intensive project .
