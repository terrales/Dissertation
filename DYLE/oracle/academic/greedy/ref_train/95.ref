the group discussed digits data , recent asr results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues .
approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted .
researchers doing asr are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data .
transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed .
the group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space .
