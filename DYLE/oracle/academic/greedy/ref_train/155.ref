an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager : the possibility to use the same system for language generation .
setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues .
having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net .
the possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further .
