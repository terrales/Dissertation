the professor told the group a story about soldiers assigned to watch out for spy planes .
the plane showed up at four each day and the soldiers called it in .
once the pattern was clear , they stopped looking for it and spent time with the locals instead .
one day , the plane did not come but the soldiers still reported it , so they got into trouble .
the professor used the story to make a point about making an assumption and then seeing if it holds after changing something small .
