several technical matters are being resolved : a conversion program is being written for data to be translated between xml and the java embedded-bayes notation ; the language generation templates are now available for the english version of the smartkom system ; smartkom now works on three different machines at icsi .
on the other hand , future collaboration on belief-nets has already been agreed with another research group .
the construction analysis and formalism are also progressing .
several issues that have been dealt with were mentioned during the meeting : indefinite pronouns and wh-questions , noun-phrase structure , etc .
this analysis is being done with the help of a linguist , who often provides different perspectives to methods and terminology .
