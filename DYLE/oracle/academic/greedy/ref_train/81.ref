the meeting began with a short introduction to hans guenter , who was arriving soon and would be visiting for a few weeks .
the team then discussed integrating mean log magnitude spectral subtraction into the smartkom system .
it seemed , however , that lengthening the time for this task was not very effective .
the team also learned more about wiener filtering which worked well when mixed with other approaches .
it was almost as effective as the best systems .
the team then delved into spectral subtraction and discussed the various ways in which it could be refined .
the meeting ended with comments on the additional latency that was caused by this method .
