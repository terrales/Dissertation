an idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager : the possibility to use the same system for language generation .
setting up certain inputs in the bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues .
there is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm .
the focus should be the bayes-net , to which all other modules interface .
situation , user , discourse and ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions .
it was suggested that they start analysing what the discourse and ontology would give as inputs to the bayes-net .
