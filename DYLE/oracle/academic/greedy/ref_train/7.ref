meeting participants wanted to agree upon a standard database to link up different components of the transcripts .
the current idea was to use an xml script , but it quickly seemed that other options , like a pfile or atlas , are more suitable .
the reason being that they would make it easier to deal with different linguistic units , like frames and utterances .
eventually , the team was skeptical of using something that would be hard to learn , like atlas .
nonetheless , they wanted to explore their options .
the meeting finished with some discussion about handling annotations .
