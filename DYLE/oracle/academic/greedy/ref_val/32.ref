the group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data .
recognition performance was very good , indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information , e.g .
prosody and overlapping speech .
it was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the sri recognizer to compare recognition performance , and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible .
