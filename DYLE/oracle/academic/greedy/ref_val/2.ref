efforts by speaker mn005 are in progress to detect overlapping speech .
for a single transcribed meeting , speaker mn005 reported approximately 300 cases of overlap .
future work will involve manually deriving time marks from sections of overlapping speech for the same meeting , and then experimenting with different measures , e.g .
energy increase , to determine a set of acoustically salient features for identifying speaker overlap .
