one of the graduate students is working on building the pda of the future .
the idea is to be able to record meetings for personal use and then query them for pertinent information .
the data collection will be anonymized to a large extent , but not so much that the meeting does not represent a real scenario .
this meeting will be one of the recorded meetings .
