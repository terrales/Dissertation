so it { disfmarker } it 's perfectly fine to put a { disfmarker } a group together again of errors and have them re - read , just to finish out the test set .
seems like we should just change the transcripts it would be interesting { disfmarker } cuz of digits .
so you just know it 's between these other things ,
