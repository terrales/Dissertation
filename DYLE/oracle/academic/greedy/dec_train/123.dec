and so i did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers .
yeah .
you can specify { vocalsound } the minimum length of speech or { disfmarker } and silence portions which you want .
and so i did some { disfmarker } some modifications in those parameters , basically changing the minimum { disfmarker } minimum { pause } length for s for silence to have , er to have , um { disfmarker } yeah { disfmarker } to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted .
so .
right .
so this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that .
speech research .
