so we took the filters { disfmarker } the fir filters { vocalsound } and we { comment } designed , uh , iir filters that have the same frequency response .
what were they thinking of changing it to ?
was n't there { disfmarker } was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they were n't looking ahead at all ?
we was think and then not necessarily .
cuz if you do n't look into the future , right ?
i have not here the proposal .
another thing i like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained { disfmarker } explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , uh , allen keeps pointing out that fletcher observed in the twenties ,
