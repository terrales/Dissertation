individual channels .
yeah .
except for { vocalsound } it does n't do well on short things , remember .
yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section when { disfmarker } in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway .
and would n't that be the same { comment } as the mixed signal ?
that 's not completely negligible .
like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so .
