so he finally had some incentive to finish , and chuck is sort of really fishing for how to keep his computer busy , what they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .
turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , i believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients .
i think you can show that uh uh analytically .
oh !
maybe we should set that up .
that would make it much easier .
