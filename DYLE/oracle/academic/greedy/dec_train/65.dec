on which tool ?
are n't they ?
takes me no time at all to edit these .
and uh , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings .
so i think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea .
not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ?
and um i think that was one of the things , well .
well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end yeah , that be good .
that would be fine too .
