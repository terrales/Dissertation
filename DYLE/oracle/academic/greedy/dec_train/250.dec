uh before you came in .
more than three of us .
new { disfmarker } new set up .
finals was that .
uh a link between the action schema , a field in the s in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use so we could { disfmarker } now the { disfmarker } the reason for { disfmarker } for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back , each module will try { disfmarker } have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents , and then { disfmarker } so you always need the whole body of { disfmarker } of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what .
or you always send it along with it , which e and how this can come about , this is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions .
that would be good .
