it seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .
you would refer up to the sentence .
so f that 's true if the features from your acoustics or whatever that are not explicitly in this are at the level of these types .
you could definitely do that with the { disfmarker } what if they have n't notated with them , times ?
but can they change the words without changing the time of the word ?
