what ?
but it would have been in principle .
now the { disfmarker } the reason for { disfmarker } for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back , each module will try { disfmarker } have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents , and then { disfmarker } so you always need the whole body of { disfmarker } of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what .
or you always send it along with it , and completely redo it , it 's rad , even !
but what if it 's not an action ?
