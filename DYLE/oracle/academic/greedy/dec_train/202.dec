and which was worse ?
so .
that 's it .
we have f a big im so { vocalsound } the major improvement that we got was in all the high mismatch cases , because all those numbers were in sixties and seventies because we never had any noise compensations .
because i did it { disfmarker } i started working on italian .
i obtained this average energy and , { vocalsound } yeah , i i i the condition where it 's better than your approach , it 's { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } just because maybe it 's better on well matched and that the weight on well matched is { disfmarker } is bigger , yeah , it 's better for high mismatch .
well , our tradition here has always been to focus on the mismatched .
cuz it 's more interesting .
