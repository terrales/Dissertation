this is obviously not usable , right .
right , it does n't work .
so , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , { vocalsound } it was just { disfmarker } you know , it was n't good enough for { disfmarker } for { pause } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } for a real system .
msg yeah .
and uh but it was all pretty artificial , and { disfmarker } and , you know , how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway ?
um { pause } so , uh { pause } this is what 's nice about the aurora data and the data here , is that { disfmarker } is that it 's sort of a realistic room situation { pause } uh , acoustics { disfmarker } acoustic situation , both terms in noise and reflections , and so on and n n and , uh , uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well .
so yeah .
