but i think that might be overdoing it a little .
so they make these decisions , although { disfmarker } uh { disfmarker } @ @ function , yeah .
we do n't have enough .
no .
and um { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } see this { disfmarker } this { disfmarker } this { disfmarker } uh { disfmarker } ontology node is probably something that i will try to expand .
once we have the full ontology api , what can we expect to get from the ontology ?
and hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know { disfmarker } or the { disfmarker }
