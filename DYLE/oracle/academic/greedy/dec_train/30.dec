no problem .
um , { vocalsound } so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as liz said the { disfmarker } we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous .

you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .

no , not { disfmarker } maybe part of it .
