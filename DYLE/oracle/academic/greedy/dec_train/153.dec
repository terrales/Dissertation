i 'm doing some as an argument .
and transcriber marks it by hand .
so , now jane , my question is { vocalsound } when they 're all done adjusting the w time boundaries for the dominant speaker , { comment } have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones ?
because there 's a part of the process of the beep file which requires knowing the normalization coefficients .
is { disfmarker } i mean it 's an infinite number of channels .
