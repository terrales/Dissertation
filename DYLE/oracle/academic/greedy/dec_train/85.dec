or { disfmarker } ?
so it 's like i have n't seen anybody using s wiener filter with spectral subtraction .
and that seems to be working .
uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better .
and that 's what causes the latency ?
ok .
on the overall estimate of the noise .
uh , i think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there .
there 's { disfmarker } the energy .
