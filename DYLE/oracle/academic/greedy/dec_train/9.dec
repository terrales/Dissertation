so you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your { disfmarker } in your xml or something .
it probably would n't be a waste .
it would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything .
you have to make a different type .
so f yeah , but it 's { disfmarker } it 's not clear that that 's { disfmarker } that 's relative to the structure of the xml document , or the time .
andreas was saying { disfmarker } yeah .
what if they have n't notated with them , times ?
