so what i 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this { pause } side .
commented and { disfmarker } what they 're about and sort of { disfmarker } the properties we may um give them .
and here are the uh { disfmarker } tasks to be implemented via our data collection .
so all of these tasks { disfmarker } the reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other .
and analogously for example , here we have our eva um { disfmarker } intention .
and these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing .
analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and { pause } that may or may not be a problem .
we can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so { disfmarker } trying to im um { disfmarker } implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .
that 's the data collection .
and um { disfmarker } and fey has some thirty subjects lined up ?
something ?
and more and more every day .
he was vicious .
well , um , these are all f people off campus s from campus so far , so the next tour will be tomorrow ?
no , not at all .
with nothing .
there 's
