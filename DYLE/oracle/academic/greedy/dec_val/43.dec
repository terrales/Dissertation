and , fff { comment } um , yeah .
what we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - english , which is always one of the best .
yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the french , from the spanish , from the timit , from spine , uh from { comment } uh english digits , and from italian digits .
so this is the { disfmarker } another line { disfmarker } another set of lines in the table .
uh , @ @ with spine because for the moment msg do does n't bring much information .
yeah , that 's without the neural net and { disfmarker } and um { disfmarker } whatever the normalization , actually .
if we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent .
so { disfmarker } i thought some of the nets were trained with spine and so forth .
so it { disfmarker } and that has other noise .
