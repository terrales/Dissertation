i just wanted to understand .
so you will have to leave what you set .
ok .
whatever .

hold on a s hold on a second .
after the third task .
well , we 'll see what people do .
i mean , in both cases it 's gon na be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .
yeah , uh , actually i guess that was my question .
is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ?
like , do the { disfmarker } an - nuh .
and it { disfmarker } and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .
i mean , w we have the for - framenet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them .
and { disfmarker } and that altogether could also be { disfmarker } uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it .
and um { disfmarker } when you said javabayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ?
or that are in the program language java ?
i was wondering .
talk features .
yep .
