so this should be semantic and { disfmarker } not in california .
you need all the other information i guess .
and sort of { disfmarker } this is a big scale comment before i , you know , look into the details of this .
but for instance you could imagine instead of having { disfmarker } i { disfmarker } i changed the name of { disfmarker } um it used to be `` entities `` .
so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` .
and `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of { disfmarker } what 's the basic predication , what event happened .
and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw { disfmarker } draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?
um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them .
and bindings to ontology items .
`` i `` within the current world .
ties it all into it .
i do n't know too much about the like grammatical { disfmarker } here it is three - fifteen already .
not really { disfmarker } just on the constructions , right ?
refer to { pause } them .
