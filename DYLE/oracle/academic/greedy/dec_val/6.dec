and so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was { disfmarker } it was a lot of engineering stuff .
no science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news .
so everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .
well , the parser , and that stuff .
mm - hmm .
yeah , that should be fine .
well , that may be another thing that keith wants to look at .
are { disfmarker } are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of the direction relative { disfmarker } relative to the speaker ?
for example , there are some differences between hebrew and english .
we can say um `` park in front of the car `` as you come beh you drive behind the car .
in hebrew it means `` park behind the car `` , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .
it 's also all on my { disfmarker } my home page at eml .
it 's called `` an anatomy of a spatial description `` .
w what does it feel like ?
this is more proximal - distal .
within that , yeah ,
