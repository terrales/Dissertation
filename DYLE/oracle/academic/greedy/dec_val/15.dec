so you will have to leave what you set .
o or later .
you have to al also have to read some digits .
s b it may { disfmarker } it may or may not be what { disfmarker } what we want .
how exactly does the data collection work ?
do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?
and then { disfmarker } or after the fourth .
some find { disfmarker } @ @ { comment } forget that for now .
and then , a human operator comes on , and { disfmarker } and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ?
now with a human operator .
and so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it .
oh , and one { disfmarker } one little bit { disfmarker } w and uh , the computer you are { disfmarker } you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via gps .
when the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know .
so the gps is crashed as well .
so the person first has to ask you `` where are you ?
`` .
and so you have to do some { disfmarker } s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there .
um , this is a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a bit that i d i do n't think we { disfmarker } did we discuss that bit ?
uh , i just sort of squeezed that in now .
but it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people i know .
so .
yeah ?
i mean that would be an { disfmarker } an { disfmarker } an enormous technical effort , unless we would { disfmarker } we can show it walks to , you know .
we can have movies of walking , you walking through { disfmarker } through heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .
which might be useful too .
but even that is problematic .
