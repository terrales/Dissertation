oh you were there ?
so you could do a { disfmarker } you could do a stricter one .
then they could n't .
i see .
just talk more .
we have not make the experiment delegate .
that 's good .
it 's good to delegate .
could you cluster the { disfmarker } just do some kind of clustering ?
bin them up into different categories and { disfmarker } right , right .
and as part of that um i wanted to see sort of how the um { disfmarker } how these models were coming out , you know , what w { vocalsound } when we train up uh th you know , the model for `` one `` , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the { disfmarker } uh what do the transition probabilities look like { disfmarker } in the self - loops , { comment } look like in { disfmarker } in those models ?
and so i talked to andreas and he explained to me how you can { vocalsound } calculate the expected duration of an hmm just by looking at the transition matrix
