so they 're just doing their own thing until { disfmarker } and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those { pause } because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .
and if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .

you had an eighteen gigabyte drive .
three or four meetings .
skip the rest of the conversation .

we 're just waiting for you to leave .
