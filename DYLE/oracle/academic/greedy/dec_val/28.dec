we are getting better .
uh , gets rid of the speech .
ex - exactly .
yeah , you got it .
um .
yeah .
maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits .
i 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the sri system and the aurora system .
and { disfmarker } um .
yeah .
so , i think i will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because { pause } this is also one big difference between { pause } the two systems .
um , the other differences were { pause } the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the sri are more { disfmarker } sri system are more complex .
but , uh , chuck , you did some experiments with this and yeah .
yeah .
this is another difference .
their normalization works like on { disfmarker } on the utterance levels .
uh , you know , at the beginning of a { disfmarker } of a { disfmarker } of an s sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , how about you , carmen ?
