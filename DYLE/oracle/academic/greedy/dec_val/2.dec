i guess it would be the same .
are n't you ?
it 's not a meeting .
three hundred overlapping speech { disfmarker } overlapping speech .
for so there 's a lot of overlap .
now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the { disfmarker } so the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the lpc residuals , such as { disfmarker } i mean there 's a bunch of things { disfmarker } i mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .
or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .
