adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there .
we 're recording , on the other side , was it twenty minutes in , yeah .
very possible .
so .
for forced alignment .
it would n't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be ok but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good .
so that 's about it .
from the outside world or and a few of the consonants .
and it gets downsampled to sixteen .
yeah , and use that .
pretty soon .
and have and stop .
