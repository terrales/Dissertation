and the downsampling must have been dan .
tw - twelve hours of work to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part { disfmarker } of f now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three { disfmarker } uh , and { disfmarker } and it might be different for government people .
so if we got someone interested in that , i think it would be great for meeting recorder .
uh anyway , i should n't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will i have to work with , with that person .
and so it 's { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you could { disfmarker } you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .
i agree .
and mari also ,
