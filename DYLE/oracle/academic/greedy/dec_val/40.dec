um , so adding msg well stephane was saying that they were n't hand - labeled , uh , training s right .
so { disfmarker } yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency { vocalsound } and the noise dependency .
and perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets .
um .
{ pause } how well do they stand up , over the { disfmarker } mmm .
yeah .
yeah , perhaps we could .
or focus more on the targets and on the training data and { disfmarker } ?
