what things to talk about .
and the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .
so that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down { disfmarker } down here ?
i can say two things about the f you need all the other information i guess .
and sort of { disfmarker } this is a big scale comment before i , you know , look into the details of this .
but for instance you could imagine instead of having { disfmarker } i { disfmarker } i changed the name of { disfmarker } um it used to be `` entities `` .
so you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` .
and `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of { disfmarker } what 's the basic predication , what event happened .
and actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw { disfmarker } draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?
um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f so that 's a .
but b , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions .
`` i `` within the current world .
here it is three - fifteen already .
not really { disfmarker } just on the constructions , right ?
refer to { pause } them .
