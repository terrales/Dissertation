so , i think this is gon na be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items , three of them were requested by jane who is not gon na be at the meeting today .
so .
{ vocalsound } the uh first was transcription status .
does anyone besides jane know what the transcription status is ?
which meetings is she transcribing ?
so , uh { disfmarker } but that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too .
um , darpa demo status , not much to say .
the back - end stuff is working out fine .
it 's more or less ready to go .
i 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type mr , edu , et cetera and also by the user id .
so that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .
uh { disfmarker } the back - end is uh , going more slowly as i s i think i said before just cuz i 'm not much of a tcl - tk programmer .
and uh dave gelbart says he 's a little too busy .
so i think don and i are gon na work on that and { disfmarker } and you and i can just talk about it off - line more .
o k .
finally said he was too busy .
i guess we reached it .
for a demo ?
and see the pitch contours also .
did they come in ?
you had an eighteen gigabyte drive .
well , except that we keep going for our full time .
well they been using timit .
well , i was gon na start off with the small train set .
we 're just waiting for you to leave .
