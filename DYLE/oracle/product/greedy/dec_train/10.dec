i 'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } into something which is { disfmarker } which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it .
like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .
from a marketing gimmick it it 's a technology thing , i guess that 's more in the sense of { disfmarker } small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you ca n't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .
i think he made that .
a snowman shape ?
would n't it .
yeah because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .
yeah but it 's also a a marketing and a function { disfmarker }
