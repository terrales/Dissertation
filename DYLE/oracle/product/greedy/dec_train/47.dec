mm-hmm , it 's about that .
make { disfmarker } that might make it a bit different from the rest at least .
um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .
so before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like { disfmarker } what do we think a good size would be for this ?
