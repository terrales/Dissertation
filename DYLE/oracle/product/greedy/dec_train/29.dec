avoid too many buttons and also um { vocalsound } one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , have the power , wherever , somewhere .
an yeah .
so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .
mm different to feel ,
