not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , we 'll have more money to go into the design side of it .

um , i 'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting i , i was n't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .
