and then we could keep it titanium .
right .
this is this is the a a { vocalsound } a remote that 's been opened up what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , i was thinking , yellow and black , just because that 's the company 's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , { vocalsound } just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .
do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
it 's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .
but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .
and with sports on television .
um the next part they want is the user interface concept .
