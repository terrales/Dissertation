marketing .
a universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .
well it can still be a { gap } , you can still extend past the hand .
so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?
and it should fit the hand .
some finger grips maybe .
you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,
