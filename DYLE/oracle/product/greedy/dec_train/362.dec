okay .
course not .
an interesting point is that if the person does n't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_ programmable memory as well .
for the remote control .
the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming different .
