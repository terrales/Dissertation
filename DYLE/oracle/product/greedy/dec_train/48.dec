yeah .
so presumably that might be an idea to put into .
make { disfmarker } that might make it a bit different from the rest at least .
um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , being as a marketing exper expert i will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ?
what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ?
