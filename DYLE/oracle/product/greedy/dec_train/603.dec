cost of living is low .
so , if we 're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .
'cause if it 's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that 's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , and a marketing strategy .
