to keep the remote ?
yeah .
there should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .
now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .
