you know like go to the base .
so this would be the front ?
it 's useful for the remote phone .
would that add to our costs at all , i wonder ?
yeah .
{ gap } and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .
if we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .
a certain phrase then it could beep .
i dunno .
just throwing it out there .
wait , on the remote itself ?
