is is it j just just to the industrial design department .
they 've gone from big brick block things , which is { gap } a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .
talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .
also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wan na make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here .
just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .
zapping functions .
so two remotes in one .
but then would be easier to lose one or the other .
