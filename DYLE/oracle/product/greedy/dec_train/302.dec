i 'm uh michael .
i 'm the user interface designer .
so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about { disfmarker } so about finances .
so { vocalsound } we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and uh we have um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } which which would generate a profit of of um { vocalsound } fifty million euros , okay .
and we should target the inter an international market .
okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they 've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wan na make , which seems to { disfmarker } a kind of a little strange if we do n't know what the the product is yet , but i guess if that 's { disfmarker } if that 's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , i guess we 're gon na need to find out what 's actually { disfmarker } you know , what people ar are willing to pay for { disfmarker } um what kind of product they 're expecting for twenty-five euro
