oh , there he is .
mm the thing is the most important things that we have now .
very important .
uh a normal wire would be better .
it could be very flat , could be very small .
i like the covers .
that 's a brilliant idea .
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , because some t_v_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
um they want to pay for an l_c_d_ screen and speech recognition .
finish meeting now .
