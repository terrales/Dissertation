yeah .
yeah .
so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?
oh .
i was not thinking too much about the price .
but if we use the l_c_d_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the t_v_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay .
if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we 'll see afterwards .
okay , uh required .
not used very often .
