yeah um .
i agree with having too many remotes around .
my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and i do n't know how to work half of them um .
what 's important for me , i guess , is that it 's easy to use and that there 's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you 're doing .
and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .
can i ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only
