{ vocalsound } alright , yeah .
{ gap } crack on { gap } .
okay so we 'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes .
i think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we 've um set out .
those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , { vocalsound } l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
um we were also going to use { gap } novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we 'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
um that pretty much sums up the last one .
so we 'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it 's possible .
oh , interface concept ?
components design .
um i mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me .
um conventional battery would seem to make sense .
i also have a preference for rubber .
can i just jump in slightly there ?
on to { vocalsound } on to the next uh to the next slide .
kinda spongy material .
you can incorporate names into the menu .
okay .
um booklet .
{ vocalsound } some pages .
mm-hmm , that 's very true .
{ vocalsound } um .
okay .
um got product evaluation as well .
um .
for the remote control .
the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming it would make sense to .
i would say to .
it would make sense if you could { disfmarker }
