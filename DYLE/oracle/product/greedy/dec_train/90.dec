we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger { disfmarker } it it 's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we could n't figure out what button is important enough to put there .
and we we do n't wan na accidentally be hitting the power button like that so { disfmarker } but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides { gap } .
right .
so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,
