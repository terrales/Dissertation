well maybe it could be a universal design .
the first and the third point , they are clashing .
yep .
um okay , so , i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this { disfmarker } a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .
so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh { disfmarker } something that would be worth implementing .
um mm there 's the l_c_d_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but i think also at the scroll wheel , i have n't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .
i think even that , i mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an l_c_d_ screen , to implement , okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
cost .
of increasing the unit price .
