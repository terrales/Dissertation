thank you very much .
that was that was great .
i 'm kind of pathetic with things like this .
um alright .
so you have your energy source , your user interface who 's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gon na control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver .
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way .
it 's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .
i suspect the remote control does need a battery , in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .
at least that 's what i have in .
