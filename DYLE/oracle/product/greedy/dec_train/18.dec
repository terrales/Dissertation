there 's one .
and see .
and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .
so if you 've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .
so a device for for all remotes .
that uh { disfmarker } maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote .
or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?
