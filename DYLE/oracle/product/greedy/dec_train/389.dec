the round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .
th elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff .
they liked square shapes with round edges .
and hard materials like wood , um titanium .
they those kind of materials they liked .
this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff .
and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like everybody 's searching in his data .
