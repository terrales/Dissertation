i know .
okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .
can i ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?
