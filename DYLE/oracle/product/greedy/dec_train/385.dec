um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , be good .
and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .
mm .
also since we 're partners of the international remote control association , maybe we wan na make it something that would globally appeal .
and maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one wo n't apply to all of the countries we 're targeting .
you 're the the industrial designer .
course you can do that .
