b you think uh i i 'm user interface manager .
uh , i do n't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency .
so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the { vocalsound } with other devices inside the home .
so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen .
well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .
