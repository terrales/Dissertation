's just an idea .
so i 'm doing the user interface design .
that was sort of the inspiration for it .
um i 've never seen that with { disfmarker } in in all my years in in the remote business .
so project manager , it 's participant one at a_m_i_ .
{ vocalsound } well , see the thing is is we 've got ta keep the company image .
not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .
{ vocalsound } like just around the lock button could be the r_r_ logo or colours and { disfmarker }
