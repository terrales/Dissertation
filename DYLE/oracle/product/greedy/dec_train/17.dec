right , so start of the first meeting .
there 's one .
but i 'll have a bash at it .
and see .
so a device for for all remotes .
maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote .
or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?
television remote control .
