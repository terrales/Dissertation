pedro can have it .
{ vocalsound } well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?
you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone .
you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after { vocalsound } { disfmarker } w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but { disfmarker } yeah , the plus there 's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less { disfmarker } b because at the moment it 's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it 's very simple , and it just works .
that was mm-hmm { disfmarker } so we need to close this meeting ,
