going to the nex next .
thank you .
uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed .
suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed .
and uh so what do we think on the concept
