user interface designer .
i 'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view .
okay , you should press next .
that 's it .
just for t_v_ remote control .
and perhaps some usability aspect .
t_v_ is becoming central in most homes .
do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
