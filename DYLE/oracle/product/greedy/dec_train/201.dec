it 's just coming on .
um about speech recognition ?
youn young people pref yeah , they s they said that they 'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .
so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .
sounds good .
yeah , f more for clap .
i think you probably should .
