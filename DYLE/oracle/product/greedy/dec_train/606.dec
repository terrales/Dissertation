and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood .
do you have any problems with that ?
this one ?
a hinge .
be like a copper hinge or you know .
yeah .
but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you do n't want it to start getting too heavy .
no , especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and
