um we could use solar cells .
or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy .
such as like watches you know .
where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy .
so um obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .
works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so { disfmarker } and then people would always know where it was .
so is the two piece idea out ?
or have we not decided ?
