and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control .
so that if the user does n't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you do n't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .
especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and what about the buttons , would { disfmarker } would the buttons be wood too , or { disfmarker } i do n't think so .
i think they could be rubber like they are now ,
