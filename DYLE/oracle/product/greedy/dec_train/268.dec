the blue one , f_n_ .
just that there 's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use .
it also mentioned something called r_s_i_ and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i_ is , but 's all still in one .
and if the whole idea is you 're using a remote then why would you have voice ,
