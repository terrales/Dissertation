and you 're going to be the user interface , user interface defin designer , yes .
well , one thing i 'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there 's there 's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you { vocalsound } you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of { vocalsound } three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it 's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the t_v_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it 's rewound , for instance .
um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design .
and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .
but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and { vocalsound } the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .
