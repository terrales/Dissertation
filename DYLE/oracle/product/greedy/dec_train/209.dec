if we { disfmarker } i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in { disfmarker } and the outside in yellow , that 'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that 's more fruity .
mm i 'd give it a four .
simple .
okay , let 's have our buttons all be one colour .
but that 's important .
six buttons { disfmarker } we have to have six buttons .
yeah , i did n't even know they existed .
and { disfmarker } but i thought we were good orally .
i think if you had a larger group { disfmarker } the slogan on it ?
