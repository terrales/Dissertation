so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective .
so which i think is a really good idea .
but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .
that also is possible .
um the next part they want is the user interface concept .
