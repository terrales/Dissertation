in project .
yeah , that was it .
so t it 's too much integrated in the other .
yes , but you could put if you do that , but i do n't know if that 's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros .
why not .
maybe you , but { vocalsound } we do n't know much about production cost , but when you { disfmarker } you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it 's a basic remote control , then the then the money { disfmarker } there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , { gap } rechargeable units .
and you can leave it just there .
yeah , probably , it would be nice .
