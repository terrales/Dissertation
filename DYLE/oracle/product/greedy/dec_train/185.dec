right .
um .
hear from the { vocalsound } user interface designer now i think might be an idea .
is it on the { disfmarker } sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or { disfmarker } and a joystick i think like i h if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one , um , i mean i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality .
which maybe does n't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .
it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes .
um { disfmarker } for volume .
speaker { vocalsound } yeah , and a transmitter .
