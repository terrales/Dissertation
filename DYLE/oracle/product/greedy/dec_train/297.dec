so if we have a l_c_d_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into a remote and navigate it .
it 's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control .
do n't use the buttons .
so { vocalsound } i i it 's not really worth to get { disfmarker } to have the image if you do n't look at , so .
put { disfmarker } i mean charger would be fixed
