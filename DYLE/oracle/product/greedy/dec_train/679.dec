i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly .
so uh i think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television .
industrial designer , okay ,
