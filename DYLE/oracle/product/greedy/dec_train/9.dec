do you know what i mean ?
so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .
um 'cause i think what we 're in what we 're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um { vocalsound } so i think we might wan na be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , that 's it .
they 're standard , are n't they ?
um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , you know shapes and things .
what what 's the functionality of that ?
feel like fruit .
