i 'm just wondering .
the battery and that { disfmarker } i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .
the quality { vocalsound } uh quality of all the components really , i mean , we ca n't really do anything { disfmarker } shoddy work , 'cause it 's and it might be too expensive .
