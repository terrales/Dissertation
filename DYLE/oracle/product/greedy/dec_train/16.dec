yeah .
um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .
'cause there 's quite often lots and lots .
and um sometimes uh they sort of { disfmarker } remote controls defeat their own purpose because you 're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .
so { disfmarker } whereas in the past you 'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote .
so so i do n't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .
that 's that 's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but { vocalsound } { disfmarker }
