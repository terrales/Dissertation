based on user perspective feedback , user interface pointed out that the buttons on remote controls are generally too many and too small .
even though they were sometimes labeled , it was still not clear for the users to tell what each button was supposed to do .
given this , user interface preferred to keep the number of buttons to a minimum and make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed .
he believed a simpler design would make the product less imposing .
