user interface suggested that the prototype of the remote control would have an ergonomic shape , be made out of wood and the colour would be customisable .
user interface also introduced the general layout of the white board under the flip : the big yellow button would be charged for turning the tv on and off , the red triangle one would be used to change the volume , while the green one controlled the channel changing .
there would be a dark blue numeric pad at the bottom and an lcd screen on the flip panel .
the prototype would have a customised backing and front .
