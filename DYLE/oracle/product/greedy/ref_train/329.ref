user interface first asked whether they could possibly leave out the number buttons , but this proposal was turned down by others .
they simplified the buttons to on-off , volume , mute , channel up/down , and the numbers 0â€“9 .
for more advanced functions , project manager suggested an additional one-for-all menu button that would allow the user to pull up various options on the tv screen .
the channel and volume buttons could be used for navigating the menu page .
