marketing drew a butterfly because she had seen one the day before , which she considered as the symbol of spring arriving .
it was the prettiest butterfly she had ever seen out in the wild , and this was quite unusual where they lived .
mistaking it as a dead leaf at first , she saw the butterfly land next to her , showing as colourful and exotica body as that of a peacock .
marketing appreciated her encounter with the butterfly very much .
