according to data , marketing thought that younger people were more interested in features like lcd screen and speech recognition .
however , older people did n't care about features so much and spent more money on remote control than younger people .
findings also showed that fifty percent of users lost remote control so bigger is better than smaller about remote control .
marketing expressed that volume button and channel button were the most important buttons so they should be found easily .
