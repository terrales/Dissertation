project manager liked the phone dial shape with their logo in the middle , but user interface thought the remote would be too wide or the buttons too small .
despite industrial designer 's proposal for scrolls , the team decided on buttons on the side instead .
for their logo , project manager suggested putting it on a major button , but user interface objected that it would wear off .
they finally decided on leaving a space on the latex cover for the logo to be always visible .
as for the colour for buttons , their decision was blue-based touch buttons with a yellow illumination .
