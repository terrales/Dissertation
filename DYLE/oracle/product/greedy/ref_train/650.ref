making a recyclable and colourful case out of plastic that was strong without using harmful materials was proposed .
for the components , there would be a resistor , a capacitor , a diode transistor , resonator , and if possible , a rechargeable battery .
also , it should have an integrated circuit board that was highly sophisticated , temperature resistant and inexpensive .
furthermore , it was hoped that there would be a timer or alarm .
for the working design , morse code would be relayed to the generator for amplification after buttons were pressed .
the team thought push buttons were better than scroll wheel as the former was more practical and cheap .
