the user interface designer thought it might be interesting to have a trigger button on the controller because it felt like there should be something , but they could n't figure out what button was important enough to put there and they did n't want to accidentally hit the power button .
then the project manager proposed that having a trigger plus the scroll might solve the problem of landing and scrolling as it would be hit on both sides .
the user interface designer agreed and further suggested tweaking that a little bit in the final design phase .
