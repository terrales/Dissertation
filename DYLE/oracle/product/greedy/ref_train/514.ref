user interface pointed out that if the remote was small , it would not go well with a base .
the team then decided on a single smaller remote instead of a bigger one with a base , and a locating device would sufficiently prevent the remote from being lost .
in terms of the battery , industrial designer suggested one small lithium battery instead of double a 's or triple a 's .
an initial lithium battery could be sold with the remote , while subsequent replacements would be bought separately .
with this suggestion in mind , the team decided to come back to it in the next meeting .
