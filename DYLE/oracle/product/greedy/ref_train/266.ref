marketing was asking what rsi was when mentioning the user needs to be easy to use .
user interface answered that it was repetitive strain injury .
so marketing denied this function because it did not match people 's operating behaviour and users wanted a remote control with fewer buttons which would be easy to learn .
just like the audio setting was not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that 's used a lot more often .
