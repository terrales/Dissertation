marketing said when he was a child , he wanted to be a panther .
industrial designer thought it would be difficult to draw a panther .
project manager thought it would be very funny for them to see marketing drawing a panther but industrial designer did n't like it .
so marketing said it was gon na be a friendly panther .
user interface supplemented that maybe it was happy because it just ate someone .
