the meeting began with the members ' personal presentations on the conceptual remote control .
the marketing would like the remote control to be with an appealing appearance and light material to attract more young consumers .
the user interface proposed to add a speak recognition system onto the remote control so that it would be able to function according to the user 's instruction .
after the presentations , they spent some time on the button layout and the shape of the remote control .
though the discussion was mostly smooth , they hardly reached an agreement towards the materials .
at the end of the meeting , the group talked about the company features on the product , including a slogan and a logo .
