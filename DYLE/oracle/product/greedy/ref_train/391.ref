marketing thought it was easy with a microphone on the remote control so that it was easy to find .
user interface agreed and thought it was better to put the microphone in a corner .
industrial designer thought no matter where the microphone was , it would not be visible .
so where to place did n't matter .
project manager thought the microphone should be in an important position to see because it was a special selling point of remote control .
