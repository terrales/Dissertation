from the last meeting , project manager concluded that the team needed to design a modern , interesting , distinctive , sturdy , positioning remote control .
in order to be distinctive , the team can adopt a spherical or keyboard shape design .
based on the market research , project manager thought that a rechargeable battery or solar cell is necessary , and the setting of the positioner and the reduction of button number is feasible .
project manager wanted the remote control to be used only for tv , which can save the budget .
for voice recognition , he thought it was unaffordable for young people , so the design was abandoned .
