the meeting mainly focused on the functional design of the remote control .
after project manager reviewed the last meeting briefly , marketing made a presentation about re-envisioning the menu functionality , current technology , and interaction with other tools of the remote control by discarding unnecessary buttons and adding the speech recognition to the remote control according to market research .
user interface argued that they should discard the existing standard , and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection , volume and enter key .
the group then discussed the source of power whether to have a charger or solar power .
although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly , the cost was much higher than using a charger .
the group faced some difficulty when deciding the target group whether for the young end or for the lower end of the age range who have more money than sense .
in the next part , the group reached a consensus in terms of the keys of the remote control , which is power , channel , volume , enter , number .
