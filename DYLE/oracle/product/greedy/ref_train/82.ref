firstly , user interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function .
the prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button .
secondly , marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals .
thirdly , the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic .
but the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials , which made the budget under control .
lastly , the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process .
