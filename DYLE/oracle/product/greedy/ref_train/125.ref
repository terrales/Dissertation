at first , project manager pointed out that the key lied in users ' pain point , which was the trouble of losing remote controls .
the team then started brainstorming in this direction , coming up with ideas such as a can opener , bouncing pads , big buttons , flashy design , changeable fronts , etc .

this idea then developed into one containing a base that could charge and track the remote control .
