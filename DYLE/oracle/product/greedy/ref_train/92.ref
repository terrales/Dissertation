the marketing expert thought there were three things making the product marketable - the features , the characteristics , and the corporation behind the product .
the features included the scroll , the locator , durability , and dependability .
the characteristics referred to reliability , comfort , ergonomics , and being environmentally sensitive .
as for the business background , they were a new company wanting to make a name for themselves and aiming at supplying good products at a fair price .
all these above made the product competitive and the marketing believed they should go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .
