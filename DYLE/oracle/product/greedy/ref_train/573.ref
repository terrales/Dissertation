first industrial designer raised questions like whether their remote control would be universal and should it be programmable or not , because they needed something like a mode to send out a different signal so that the remote can work in this way .
then the size of the remote was also put by industrial designer since there were already plenty of technical parts in it and it was quite complex to deal with material problems .
but at last industrial designer came up with the idea of integration of materials and in this way , the new product would cost less .
