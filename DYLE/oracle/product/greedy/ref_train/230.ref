the meeting mainly discussed the design of functions and the appearances .
on function wise , the group had a little argument whether to make the product multi-functional or single functional .
in the end they went with single-functional because it was more focused and affordable .
they also removed some of the functions being discussed such as lcd screen , teletext and voice recognition , because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design .
on design wise , the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights .
they also included some humanitarian factors into the design .
