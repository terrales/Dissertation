marketing made a presentation on important aspects the team need to pay attention to concerning the remote control market .
a most important aspect is its look and feel , so that the remote control has to look and feel fancier to meet customer 's demands .
the second point is that it should be technologically innovative .
and then they found that the decisions the team had already made on interface did n't match the first two points that marketing had raised .
then they discussed the bluetooth function which was turned down and on the kinetic provision of energy .
user interface suggested using squeezable rubber which could be an energy generator .
the third point that marketing raised was easy to use .
she suggested that next year 's fashion would be fruits and vegetables so the team had the idea of making some buttons into fruit shapes .
regarding the color of the control , project manager had the idea of marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people like ipod .
