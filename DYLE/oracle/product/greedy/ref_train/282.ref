they drafted several potential product names , including `` banana '' , `` rc deluxe '' , `` real reactor '' , `` triple rc '' , etc .
they concentrated on adjusting the `` triple rc '' , and eventually decided on `` triple r '' .
the group thought this name was cool , and especially looked cool when it was printed in the front , and it was catchy .
