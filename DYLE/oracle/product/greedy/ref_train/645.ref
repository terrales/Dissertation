marketing made evaluation criteria .
the first thing was fancy look and feel , the second was innovativeness , the third was easy to use .
then marketing asked industrial designer and user interface to give scores towards two versions of the prototype according to the scale .
both industrial designer and user interface gave three or four points to look and feel , six points to innovativeness and also six points to easy to use .
the team decided to make the remote control without lcd and to improve the design to make it fancy .
they would have all the functions in the same set , but some functions , like speech recognition , would be optional .
the team would look into the shape and material of the set .
