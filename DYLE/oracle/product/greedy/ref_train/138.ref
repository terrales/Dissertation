the team agreed that the prototype had a moderate appearance and it really depended on the individual taste of each customer .
some might find the device really fancy .
however , the function that enabled the user to design for its own front look stood out since this could add value to users ' favour towards personalities .
the team also came to an agreement that the remote control 's relevant buttons were prominently visible and relevant to each other , making the device easy to use .
there was also a speaker incorporated into the device , solving the problem that sometimes it was out of sight .
meanwhile , the innovation of this device which was without a lcd display or any other technology required functions was not that satisfactory .
