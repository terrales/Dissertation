the user interface designer suggested two options of making the remote control functional .
one way was to make it multi-functional , so as to be used for several entertainment devices .
another way was to make it single-functional , which could be used specifically for the television .
the entire group preferred the product to be single-functional .
it is because making an original design was more obtainable , and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .
they had to make it compatible with different brands of devices to sell internationally .
