the team first hesitated between double a and triple a batteries .
double a 's would be more convenient for customers , since most people usually have this type around .

industrial designer then proposed that they could also try a small lithium battery .
with all these possible options , project manager decided that they should leave this question aside and move on with the meeting , as long as they kept the battery problem in mind .
