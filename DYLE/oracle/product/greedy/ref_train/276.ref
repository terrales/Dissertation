project manager first introduced the budget and broke it down to parts like batteries , electronics , case material supplements , interface type and then button supplements .
the team agreed that the push button , integrated scroll-wheel and the lcd display cost a lot but case materials were all the same .
in this case , the team decided to discard the lcd since the information it could transmit could also be simply displayed on the screen .
as for the recognition feature , the team decided to make it a big deal to be alarming .
and lastly , the product would be pure yellow instead of a blue button .
