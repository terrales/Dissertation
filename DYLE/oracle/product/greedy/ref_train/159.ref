one function could be to let the buttons be distinguishable even in the dark , so that one could use the remote whether there was light or not .
another function could be to track the remote when it goes lost , probably realized through some kind of alarm on the remote and a button installed somewhere else .
one last proposed function was to design a hidden panel for the remote , containing all the less used buttons so that they would n't take up too much space on the main panel and confuse the user .
