there should be a strong and recyclable case that was not made from harmful materials such as plastic .
a resistor , capacitor , diode , transistor , circuit board and resonator should be in the remote , along with a timer and alarm facility .
the integrated circuit could be highly sophisticated for higher efficiency and should be resistant to high and low temperatures .
also , colouring components could be used if the remote was to have different colours .
for the battery , it could be rechargeable as people can use it for a long time and saves costs for production .
