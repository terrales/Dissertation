after a thorough discussion , the team finally reached a consensus that the new design would have seven functions .
first , the new remotes would dis-include teletext because that was obsolete .
second , they wanted to integrate the corporate colour and slogan in the new design .
third , speech recognition would be included .
fourth , the new remotes could glow in the dark .
fifth , there would be limited buttons on the remotes .
sixth , the design was organic .
seventh , the new remotes would be with programmability .
