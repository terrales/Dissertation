project manager suggested having a large version of the company 's logo in the middle of the remote .
user interface pointed out that this design would make the remote too big and wide to fit into one hand .
furthermore , a large logo would take up so much space that the buttons would have to be smaller , and thus they would be less discernible .
project manager acknowledged that user interface 's argument was reasonable .
user interface then proposed an alternative design , curving the remote like a hand with scroll buttons on the side .
