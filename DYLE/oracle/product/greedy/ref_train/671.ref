when everybody was using buttons , a scroll wheel would be new and different , which might push somebody over the edge when they were looking at the new controller versus something else .
plus , many people today were television surfers , and the scroll was a great mechanism for surfing .
but there were two problems with the scroll wheel .
on one hand , it broke down easily and would bring down the robustness of the whole product .
on the other hand , users had to scroll really slowly to keep in pace with the tv 's ability to change channels , which would be frustrating .
