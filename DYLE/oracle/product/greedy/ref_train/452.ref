marketing mainly focused on users ' frustrations and expectations for remote controls .
apart from the requirements for a fancier look , shock-resistance , and limited but usable buttons , other expectations were also raised by users , such as the need to be found , to easily use , to light in the dark , and the need of ergonomic design .
moreover , lcd and speech recognition also seemed important , especially for people between 15 and 25 who watched tv a lot .
last but not least , the previous plan for a generic remote control for everything failed due to the imbalance between the long developing time and the timely need to be on the market .
