they all agreed that speech recognition could be taken out , because lcd had more support on the customer side , and it did not give an extra function compared to other normal remote controls .

however , after evaluating dropping other features such as rubber or curve , they agreed that both of them brought more advantages than the special colour .
besides , the colour could be made up by using special covers .
