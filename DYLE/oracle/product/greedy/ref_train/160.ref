the idea of giving the remote a novel shape instead of the standard rectangular was first raised by project manager .
marketing proposed a possible shell shape for the remote .
industrial checked whether they were going into novelty factors because the remote still had to be universally acceptable if they wanted it to sell .
yet it could n't be too boring , so it would be key for the team to figure out a way for the remote to be trendy and original , but at the same time not too outrageous .
