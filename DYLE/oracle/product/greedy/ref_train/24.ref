the first design obviously met the requirements of the budget so the team focused on the second one to see whether the combination of the two designs could together form an innovative design but was under the budget at the same time .
to cut costs , the project manager first suggested using normal chips only in exchange for the speech recognition function .
the special color was left to the case and it was designed as curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well .
later , the team had argued a lot whether to eliminate the number of buttons or to discard lcd displays .
however , if the number of buttons were to be eliminated , it would be far more complicated to use the device , since users must press one button several times to get to the channel .
after a vote and discussion about the cost , the team decided to discard both the lcd display and the speech recognition functions since they were really expensive and the later one could not work without the existence of the former one .
