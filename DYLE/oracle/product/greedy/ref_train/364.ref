this meeting was a conceptual design meeting .
in this meeting , the group mainly discussed the component , energy source , buttons , colours and styles of the remote control .
they decided to use the kinetic as the energy source because of its convenience , light weight , fancy design and the good selling point of the environment , but they still needed more cost research .
they also reached a final consensus to apply a hard plastic inner shell with a spongy plastic for the component , and push buttons for the type of interface due to their common features of convenience and user-friendliness .
