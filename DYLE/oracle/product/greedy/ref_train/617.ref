the user interface showed the pictures of one kind of remotes with scrolls on it , working as the middle buttons .
if the consumers wanted to find a certain item , they just needed to scroll it and when they reached the required ones , they pressed the middle of the scroll .
although the team was not satisfied with the colour , shape and buttons of the existing , they all agreed that the function of a scroll was a good idea .
