the group had a production cost of 12.5 euros .
they agreed to not add solar cells for power source nor a sample speaker instead of a simple beep .
they would have one battery , two regular chips on the print , double curves which stuck to the plastic , two scroll wheels , and three push buttons .
the group would not use lcd and they would have a base station that was made out of units of plastic to balance the cost .
