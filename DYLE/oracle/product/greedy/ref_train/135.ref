firstly , user interface and industrial designer introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its form , material and the colour .
the prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle .
secondly , marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the advantages of its main features discussed before and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals .
lastly , the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that it was not easy to land on the exact budget .
after trying to incorporate as many functions as the team could for a while , the team decided to use regular chips , normal batteries and a combination of cheap materials and fancy ones , which made the budget under control .
