firstly , the team decided that the target functions of the remote control would just be for the television .
secondly , they removed functions that were previously discussed , such as teletext , lcd screen and voice recognition .
particularly for the teletext function , they were removing it because they were reaching out to an international crowd and some countries did have such things as teletext .
they kept the alarm idea because it was not expensive to actualize .
