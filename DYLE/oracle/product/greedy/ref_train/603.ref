user interface proposed to reconsider the necessity of adopting a display in consideration of two factors .
one was that the television screen already made a big display , the other was that the cost-efficiency of a display was doubtful .
in view of the cost constraint , sacrificing the display feature could be a reasonable option .
project manager then asked marketing to conduct research on this subject before making the final decision about the adoption of the display .
