the must-haves would include volume control , channel keys up-down , a numerical keypad , a mute button and would exclude the lock button which was discussed in the precedent meeting .
he made an introduction of two types of remotes : engineering centred ones which provide a lot of functionality and user centred which focus on the easiness of use .
later , the team discussed the locking function which project manager expected greatly , and also on the integration of the corporate image into the design of the remote control .
at last , regarding the layout of the remote control , user interface would like to make some improvements over two buttons concerning the ergonomic design .
