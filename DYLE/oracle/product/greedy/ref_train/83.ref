the prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and an on-off button .
the color of the prototype was vanilla and yellow like and the material was a combination of rubber and plastic with a company logo .
moreover , there was a circular design for the numbers so it could be palm-held , accessible from the user ' thumb .
besides , a plus button was added on the device so the channels could be switched easily without any confusion.for instance , one plus two it could go to channel twelve .
but this function was challenged by industrial designer who argued that it was not snappy since the five-second pause input time was enough for switching to the double-digit channel .
after all , the team agreed that it was overall , a good design , well representing the company 's identity .
