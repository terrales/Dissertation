the group discussed the final remote concepts after three presentations .
therefore , they decided to have a small-sized remote with the speaker , the power with the chip on print , a transparent case , and rubber incorporated into the case .
however , they would not go for an lcd partly because they needed an input device instead of output and the cost would be added .
