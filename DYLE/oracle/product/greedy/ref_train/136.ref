the prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle .
there were also power buttons and nine others for switching channels with the incorporation of the menu and teletext .
in the middle there was a part of hard material , a bit of hard plastic with a light behind it .
in terms of materials and color , the team designed one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber buttons .
also , the team agreed that the company logo , together with the standard color could be the company 's identity .
last but not least , the current device did not include the docking station but the marketing expressed his interest towards it and the team decided to reconsider it in the following parts of the meeting .
