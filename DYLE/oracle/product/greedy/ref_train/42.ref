the animal user interface drew was a badger .
when project manager demanded the reason for this unusual choice , user interface first answered that it was because badgers were grumpy and nocturnal .
industrial designer joked about whether this suggested that user interface had the same characteristics .
user interface then explained that his/her favourable impression of the badger came from books like wind in the willow , where badgers were cooler animals than what people generally imagine them to be .
