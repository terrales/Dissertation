through a series of previous adjustments , the cost of the new remote controls had been effectively reduced .
the team then decided to use some of the remaining cost budget to add another design to the new remotes .
after discussion , the team thought it might be a good idea to have the slogan on the front because there was obviously more space there and the current slogan was not in an ideal place .
with this little change , the overall cost of the new remote each went up to twelve euros fifty , still under the budget limit .
