the team discussed a marketing survey about remote controls .
they agreed to design remote controls with more fancy outlook and less buttons .
the remote control should be easier to find and less complicated so users take less time to learn the functionality of it and the team discussed how to implement this function .
they also talked about voice recognition and the scroller button .
then they agreed to design a child lock .
users could open child lock by pressing the button with some code .
at last they discussed the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser .
they decided to put numbers and words in the vocabulary .
but they realized that it would be a challenge to make the speech recogniser distinguish between different voices and deal with noises and they would keep on discussing it .
