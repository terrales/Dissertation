according to project manager , currently , the new remote controls would cost fourteen point six euros each .
unfortunately , that was two euros over the budget .
then the team had a little discussion on how to reduce the cost .
eventually , the cost was reduced to eleven euros sixty by adjusting two parts of the design .
that left them plenty of room to add some other designs to the existing models .
the final cost of the new remote controls was set at twelve euros fifty each .
