buttons design was all about volume , channel , power , and some other instant ideas .
the team discussed their sizes , big or small , and places , up , center , or down , and also their arrangements , vertical or horizontal , and reached a conclusion that the power button could be on top .
they came up with mute button as well but project manager did n't think it was important .
