regretfully , marketing did not get specific user requirements for now .
instead , user interface made a contribution to the discussion .
users mainly expected the remote control to be user-friendly .
to be more specific , the button size ought to be regular , and the remote control was expected to be a handy and small unit .
it would be more satisfying if the zapping range was big enough so that the remote control could work from a distance .
