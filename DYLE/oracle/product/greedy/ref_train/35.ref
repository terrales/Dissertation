altogether , there were three advantages .
the first was the simplicity of use .
in the market , lots of remotes had many buttons because companies believed that more buttons they added , the more their consumers would appreciate .
however , the fact was that many people did n't know how to use these buttons at all .
the redundant buttons only increased the difficulties for people to use .
the second was the decrease in cost since fewer buttons were needed .
the last was the increase in sales and profits .
