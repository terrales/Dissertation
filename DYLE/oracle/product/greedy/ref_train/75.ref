the basic components included power source , user interface , a programmable digital signal processor , on-off switch , encryption codes for the different modes of tvs , and memory system .
then user interface presented the basic layout of how the remote would work .
in terms of the cost , the most costly component was the chip and the casing would be expensive as well .

the price of the chip depended on what functionality the product would have and how much the battery capacity and storage would be .
for the moment , they did n't have a ballpark figure .
