user interface suggested a simple plastic remote control in yellow and black with few big buttons which could correspond to a screen on the television screen .
but this idea of having a screen on the television screen was faced by industrial designer 's objection .
industrial designer preferred scroll buttons , and a simple but functional menu on the screen , and simple push buttons .
in the end , they chose a push button for better feasibility .
