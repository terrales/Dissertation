project manager appreciated the idea of a joystick .
an lcd menu screen on the joystick would consume quite low power .
a fair amount of information could be read on the screen display .
other functionality would be associated inside the menu by traversing around .
project manager agreed with user interface that buttons could only be used for default functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping once there was a functional joystick .
