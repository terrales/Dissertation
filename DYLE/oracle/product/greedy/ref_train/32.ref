this meeting took up the discussion from the last one .
they specified the ideas brought up last time and adapted them according to the market potentials and budget limits .
marketing first reported their findings of market potentials .
altogether , they summarized four conclusions : ( 1 ) consumers were willing to spend more for fancy products ( 2 ) the current products did n't always match users ' operating behaviours ( 3 ) a lot of buttons were n't used ( 4 ) they were not fun to use .
then , the team came up with a novel feature of automatic speech recognition to retrieve the remotes .
in the latter half of the meeting , the team decided that the following functions would be for the new remotes : speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design , programmability , glowing in dark , and integrating the logo and slogan .
