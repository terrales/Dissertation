this was the conceptual design meeting for the remote .
the first presentation was given by marketing on trend watching .
marketing pointed out that customers wanted the remote to be technologically innovative and yet simple to use , and that the current fashion trend was fruits and vegetable patterns .
clearly labelled large buttons with the company logo and colour scheme were also preferred .
user interface followed with the presentation on interface concepts , proposing to have a scroll-down design and a distinctly recognizable demographic for specific buttons .
industrial designer 's presentation on component design provided information for the material needed for the remote , and certain restrictions coming with different options .
after user interface 's additional thoughts on voice recognition , the team discussed designs of the energy source , the material , and the user interface concept , deciding on latex covers , the gun-metal grey colour , and blue and yellow touch buttons .
