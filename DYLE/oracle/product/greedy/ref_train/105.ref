the user interface designer was trying to implement a more dynamic and youthful colour on the remote control .
however , the designers did not want it to be too childish and stated their will to make it more of an adult-style .
thus they wanted to use metallic grey as the colour of the appearance , and make an extra cover with flashy fruity colours to attract the broader public .
since their target aim was still younger people , a cover would make them more flexible to change the remote control into whatever colour they wanted .
