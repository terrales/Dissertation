this is the second meeting of the design group .
project manager went through the notes of the last meeting and informed the team of the management 's requirements .
they expected the remote control to cover television only and asked the team to incorporate the company logo and colours .
as the team is looking at extreme simplicity , the buttons should be reduced to the absolute minimum .
voice recognition can also be added to reach this point .
in addition , the remote control can be powered by a rechargeable or permanent battery .
