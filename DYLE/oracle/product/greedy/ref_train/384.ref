the team agreed that the joystick handle must be easy to operate by one hand , with some ups and downs behind it , so as to be more user-friendly .
the remote control needs to be longer to indicate the direction of the remote control .
for convenience , the project manager proposed to install sensors at both ends , but the industrial designer thought that the more technology investment , the higher the cost .
the numbers and buttons on the remote control can clearly indicate its direction .
in addition , he proposed that it should not be too small , or it might be hard to design functions .
