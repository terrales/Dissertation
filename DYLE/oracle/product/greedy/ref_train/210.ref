the meeting began with the harsh budget problem that the group had to cut down something of the current conceptual remote control , otherwise they would be unable to handle the cost .
they talked about reducing the buttons , integrating functions , or using cheaper materials .
after the discussion , the marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they were on the right track .
through the questionnaire , they found that it would be better if they paid more attention to the external design so the industrial design embellished the current design on the color and logo .
as the last thing left to the meeting , the group reviewed their cooperation and got a general plan of their coming group presentation .
