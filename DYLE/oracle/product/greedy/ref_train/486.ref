industrial designer and user interface presented a prototype of the new remote control according to the team 's previous meetings .
however , due to the budget limit , the team had to give up the spongy rubber material and the double-curved design .
instead , the remote control would be made of plastic and have only one curve .
there would not be any location function , either .
the team decided to make the remote control conspicuous by designing a bright yellow banana shape in case it got lost easily in a room .
in the product evaluation , the team was satisfied with its success in reducing the number of unused buttons .
the user interface was considered to be user-friendly enough .
however , the team also admitted that there was still room for improvement on the location function , technological innovation , the material , as well as the fashion style of the remote control .
at the end of the meeting , all team members expressed themselves about the teamwork sincerely .
