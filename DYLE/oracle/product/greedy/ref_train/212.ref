when discussing how to control their budget , the industrial design put forward to use an integrating joystick or a scroll-wheel push-button like the mouse to reduce the number of the buttons on the remote control .
it did sound great for that it allowed users to function the remote control by manipulating only one button as well as saved the cost for the group .
however , according to the user interface , actually it could cost even five times to design and produce an integrating button than just produce several scattered buttons , so this might not be a feasible suggestion .
