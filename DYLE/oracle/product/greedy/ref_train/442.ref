the remote control would have a chip in the integrated circuit , taking power from the battery and transforming input from buttons through wires into infrared signals to electronic devices .
there will be buttons and underneath them are switches and bulbs .
to hold everything in , there should be a case and a remote holder .
the material used for the remote should be human friendly so that it will not cause any skin disease or allergy to either children or adults .
the frequency of each electronic device is different so it would be very difficult to design a control for multiple devices .
