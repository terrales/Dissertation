according to the project manager , it was hard to have speech recognition in remotes and no products in the market now used this function well .
there was mainly one reason : the noise interference problem , which was too expensive to solve .
luckily , the user interface came up with an idea to have something built into the tv that people could press and then it would send out a little signal .
the industrial designer agreed and proposed to have a microphone by the tv speaker and a transmitter there to send back to their remotes .
such design was subtractive cancellation of the noise .
