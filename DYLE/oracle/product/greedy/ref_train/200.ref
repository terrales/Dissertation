according to the research of marketing , three quarters of the customers thought that their remotes are ugly .
people only concentrated on the channel buttons , the volume buttons and the power buttons , and other buttons on the remote were seldom pressed .
many customers found it frustrating when their remotes were lost somewhere else in the room and they could n't find them .
besides , it was difficult for people to learn all the functions on the remote .
then the team discussed the idea of a speech recognition system for the remote .
