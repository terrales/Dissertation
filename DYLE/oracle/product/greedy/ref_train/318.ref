when a button was pressed , a small circuit underneath the button would send signals through the wires to the chip .
the chip would know which button was pressed and produce a morse code signal specific to that button , which the transistor would amplify the signal .
the led would receive the signal and translate it into infrared light .
the sensor on the tv would receive the infrared light which contained the signals and would react accordingly .
