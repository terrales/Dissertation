when discussing the criteria on whether people would change their remote control , user interface gave a two out of seven on it because of the negative impression the banana brought .
in fact , user interface did n't want a banana on the living room table though the product was handy , unless other twenty-five-euro remote controls looked ugly .
while , user interface thought it still had the word of its feature at the beginning , so user interface changed to give four on this criteria question .
