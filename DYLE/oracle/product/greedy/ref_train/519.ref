for the logo to remain despite latex cover changes , project manager proposed to print it on a button .
yet user interface opposed this idea for fear that the print would wear off .
industrial designer suggested putting the logo on the back of the remote , but this option was ruled out since the logo must be always visible .
user interface presented another option where the remote would consist of two pieces , but this too was incompatible with the cover design .
finally , industrial designer suggested leaving a cut-out space on latex covers to show the logo , and all agreed on this design .
