in the budget balancing , user interface desired an articulation , which would , however , lead the remote control to be double-curved .
initially , project manager was not sure about this , for the double-curved design would go over the budget .
industrial designer pointed out that a single curve would still allow the articulation .
the remote control could be made in two parts and joined together with the articulation .
project manager accepted industrial designer 's proposal .
