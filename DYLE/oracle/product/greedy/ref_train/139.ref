firstly , the team agreed that only one battery is enough and using kinetic was not a must since it would be too expensive and useless .
secondly , one chip was enough and they were going to choose one from different types of regular chips .
however , as the team found out they could incorporate more valuable components , the team decided to use one advanced chip for now .
in terms of the material used on the device , the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special materia , like titanium , as well as a special color .
moreover , the teletext was discarded and the docking station was added .
as for the infrared led , although it was originally presented on marketing 's powerpoint , the team agreed that it was not helpful .
later , the team found that regular chips were enough for the scroll-button and only the lcd display required the advanced ones , so again the team came back for the regular chip and cut some costs .
in the end , the team incorporated solar cells for the battery .
