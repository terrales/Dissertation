marketing disagreed by pointing out that tv was mostly used with vcr or dvd player or recorders , functions for which should be included , rather than with a stereo .

the discussion took a turn when the user interface disagreed and suggested designing a remote control only for televisions .
project manager insisted on including other functions as most remote controls did and everyone was on board in the end .
