it was first suggested by user interface that a charging base would not go well with a small remote .
the team agreed on this , and project manager reminded them the remote was not going to be a huge one .
user interface worried that a small remote without a base could be more easily lost , but marketing reassured the team that this would n't be a problem if the remote had a locating device .
each team member then gave his/her opinion on the issue , all preferring a smaller remote without a base .
