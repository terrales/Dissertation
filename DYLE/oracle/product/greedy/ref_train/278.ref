the discussion in this meeting focused on detailed design .
first of all , the prototype was presented , which was pretty much like what the group had agreed before , including the yellow colour , cover and buttons made by rubber , etc .
however , what they had exceeded their expected budget .
therefore , they had discussions on which features were okay to be taken out .
they finally agreed on removing speech recognition , and the special colour .
then they did an evaluation of their product , and overall they did well .
to sum up this teamwork experience , the project manager emphasized the importance of the communications .
at last , they had a discussion on the product name , and agreed on `` triple r '' .
