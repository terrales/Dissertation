project manager mentioned four points .
firstly , project manager pointed out that teletext was outdated and internet would be the main focus .
then it was proposed that the remote control would only be used for tv , rather than a multi-purpose one .
what 's more , the project should target a new customer group , which was younger than 40. logo and slogan of the remote control were required to attract more attention , but it was not for now .
