according to the lab tests , users only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote .
it was shown that users did n't really need all the buttons provided by current remotes , and it would be more user-friendly if their new remote could lose the unnecessary ones .
the most frequently used buttons were those for the channel , the volume and the power on/off .
