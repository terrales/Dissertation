the industrial designer suggested that when taking environmental impact into consideration , the product could switch to a more environmental-friendly material .
this type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory , and it also allowed recycling .
hence , the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls .
even though the team liked the idea , the product manager also raised his concern towards the financial budget .
in the end they agreed to discuss further about how they could achieve the idea by not exceeding the budget .
