the whole meeting was the final meeting of the project for discussion about the final design and project evaluation .
firstly , though project manager came late , he efficiently started the prototype presentation , during which industrial designer and user interface presented the final design they worked out together .
however , part of the features contained in their design , particularly too many buttons , were effectively rejected in the finance phase to reduce cost .
then , marketing hosted the product evaluation and calculated a total score for their new remote control .
after that , project manager guided the process evaluation and led the project to the closing phase .
