this was the last meeting on the remote project .
industrial designer and user interface first gave the prototype presentation with a model remote they made based on previous team decisions , showing the design of colours , buttons , and shapes .
marketing then led the discussion on the evaluation criteria of their product , after which the team evaluated the remote in various aspects .
as for finance , the team calculated the costs of each component of the remote , finding the total cost under their budget and thus allowing the remote to go into production .
finally , the team talked about their experience in the project process , digressing into a casual discussion on computers , cell phones , and ideas for commercials .
the team members thanked each other for their effort .
