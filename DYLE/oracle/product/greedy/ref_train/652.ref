the prototype was attractive , bright blue and snail shaped with buttons in different colours such as yellow .
it was compact so it could easily fit in the hand and buttons could be easily accessed .
moreover , the material for the case would be plastic but the buttons would be made with soft rubber .
for the light emitting diode of the led , it would be fluorescent green and it would be a bulb like an ordinary infrared .
last but not least , there would be an oyster-shaped holder for the remote .
