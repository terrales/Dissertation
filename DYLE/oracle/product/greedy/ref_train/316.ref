the interfaces shown on the slides were a remote that had voice recognizer with multi-purpose use such as for tv and cable-satellite , a simple and compact one that a child can use and could play with it and a big oversized remote that can not be misplaced .
the team agreed that the t-shaped design and the children-friendly interface were nice but the over-big one was not ideal .
