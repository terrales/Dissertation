project manager began functional design meeting with reviewed last meeting and looked at new project requirements .
the group did a presentation and made discussion about conceptual remote control design .
they decided to use the lcd screen in the design as it was popular for the market and hard to damage .
because of the high price of lcd , the group put up a backup design with buttons instead of lcd as a solution .
after group discussion , remote control would be designed with buttons shape and functions such as channels selection and speech recognition .
