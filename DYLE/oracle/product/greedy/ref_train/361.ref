user interface pointed out that the keypad might irritate users , for it was hard for them to remember the exact number of every channel .
instead , user interface recommended the lcd screen menu display .
with the menu structure , channels could be better classified into subgroups .
users could name these subgroups as `` news '' , `` music '' and so on .
