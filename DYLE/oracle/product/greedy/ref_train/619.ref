the team was offered a bunch of options about the material of the outer casing from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , latex , double-curved , curved , sponge , etc .
after discussion , they decided that they would have the sponge rubber as their outer casing because it had the elasticity and durability which they needed .
also , this kind of material was cheap to cast .
