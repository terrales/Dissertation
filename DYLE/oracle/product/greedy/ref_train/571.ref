marketing gave a presentation in the first place based on research and came up with ideas like what their remote control should look like , buttons design , whether the new product should have lcd screens .
marketing also suggested that there could be any chances that remote control could know users ' preference channels , and there would be a beep when they could n't find control .
then user interface delivered a speech mainly on the size of buttons and remote control , and agreed to find remote control easier and increase its durability .
at last , industrial designer did an analysis on what marketing and user interface said before and claimed that there still needed a lot to know but integration of materials meant less cost for the production and they should make up a different morse code when some button was pressed .
