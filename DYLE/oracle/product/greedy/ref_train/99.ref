as to cater to the fashion trend , the group decided to put the remote control in a fruity shape and a bright lovely color .
then in order to make their product both good-looking and comfortable to hold , they reached the agreement that the front side of the remote control would be made of plastic while the back would be made of titanium .
the group also spent some time on the internal design of the product , for example , the chip would be made of silicon and electrical cable would be just the same as other counterparts .
