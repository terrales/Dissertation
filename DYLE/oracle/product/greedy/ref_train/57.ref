industrial designer suggested that the remote control needed to be able to turn the television on and off , control the volume and the menu , change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
as for the material used for the construction of the outer case , it needed to be not only flexible and inflatable , but also waterproof .
the product itself would be better if it could change in size depending on user preference .
in addition , the remote control should be able to respond to the user by sending out an oral cue in order to show that it understood your message correctly .
