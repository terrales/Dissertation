the whole meeting was about what the group should do for the remote control , from a good-looking appearance to a joyful user experience .
at the beginning , the group had individual presentations about their previous research findings .
through those presentations , all of the four got a general idea about the target market , the functions and the layout .
they talked about the functions carefully as well as the interface design of the remote control later on .
finally , under the leadership of the project manager , all the members got some assignments for their next detailed design .
