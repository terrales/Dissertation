marketing liked how users could reach all the buttons with one thumb , even for someone with a small hand , so users did not need to shift it around or operate with two hands .
also , it was good that the on-off button was in a prominent place and the colours of the remote were attractive .
mute buttons were on either side so it would work for left- or right-handed people .
on the other hand , channel buttons would be inscribed with numbers and the rest would be marked with easily recognized symbols that would be ideal for the international market .
