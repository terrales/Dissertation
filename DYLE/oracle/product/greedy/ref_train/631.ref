user interface made a presentation on buttons the control should include and on the layout of the buttons .
the team vetoed the idea of the speech recognition interface which is expensive and unnecessary .
at last the team decided not to have any sort of display , but a simple straight set of push-buttons , with a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , a numerical keypad , and a lock button or a cover .
then they discussed some supplements like colours or particular gimmicky bits .
user interface proposed the utilization of a couple of colours like black and yellow , with special parts like the rr logo in yellow .
user interface suggested having a rubber case for safety reasons .
