channel selection is um very important , very often used .
volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course .
and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings .
audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
all of them .
they 're not often used and they are s more or less relevant .
it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if i personally never use it but seems that it 's average relevant at least , so .
