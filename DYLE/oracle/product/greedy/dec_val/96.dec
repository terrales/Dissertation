maybe it 's important to make it compatible with the d_v_d_ player it has to be different and familiar at the same time .
it it has to be custom made for the hand .
right maybe something like this a big recognisable button on top or something .
well i have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons yeah that 's right .
mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote 's also my task , yeah .
