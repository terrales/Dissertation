it 's just gon na be a television remote .
{ vocalsound } um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .
which adm admittedly is gon na come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , or not .
uh .
oh there we go .
perfect .
okay .
so this is me .
um basically i was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort { disfmarker } like watching a hundred people { vocalsound } use t_v_ remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general t_v_ remote control practices .
um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody 's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that 's all that 's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they 're important , but the primary uses are really really basic .
um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public 's use , they 're not using a lot of it , they do n't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do n't know what to do with .
{ vocalsound } and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their { disfmarker } the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it .
and then they ca n't find it in the room .
so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .
{ vocalsound } um there 's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , is that only gon na be within our two hundred foot range then ?
those new ones .
for twelve euros ?
{ vocalsound } the basics .
we put fashion into electronics .
good idea but yeah i 've put my files in the shared folder as well .
