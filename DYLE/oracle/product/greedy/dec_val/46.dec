they the the the the the side view , why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , uh titanium-coloured plastic ?
you want to dump the titanium ?
or change the titanium or dump the l_c_d_ screen .
but i think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the l_c_d_ screen .
and uh unrealistic .
well uh they they did n't think of the requirements .
it 's the requirements of the user , uh i guess .
{ vocalsound } it was a complete disaster .
i if it if it would be perfect following .
