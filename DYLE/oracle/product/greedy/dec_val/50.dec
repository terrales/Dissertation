one more .
um because its uh not so expensive .
and there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that .
there 's a lot of small uh electronics .
so it wo n't be um uh too expensive to build it .
only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it .
now { gap } { disfmarker } and here i have the top of the remote control .
uh here 's some kind of chip .
uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers .
uh you have all on your remote control .
and uh the teletext uh button .
and uh here 's the battery .
and when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip .
and the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components .
that 's what i said , it 's very difficult .
but now we have only the buttons .
