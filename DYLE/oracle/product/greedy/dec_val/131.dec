i have to do working design so uh and we can put all the options into this screen .
we 'll need only few buttons .
all the other things can be controlled through the screen .
and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch .
so { disfmarker } press { disfmarker } i would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium yeah , so that we just use simple recog because it 's it 's very expensive and volume control .
uh of course the u_i_d_ mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept that would be enough .
