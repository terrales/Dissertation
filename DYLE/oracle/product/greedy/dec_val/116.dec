how was lunch ?
{ vocalsound } three .
i thought you like it .
ah okay the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .
okay .
so it could be smart in that way .
yeah , marketing expert .
it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .
so as you see uh { vocalsound } it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control .
{ vocalsound } when we were talking about rubber , i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it 's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , fruit .
even shape ?
even design .
