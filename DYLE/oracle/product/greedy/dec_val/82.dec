industrial designer .
interface concept .
our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to .
and then , i 'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
first uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours .
like , totally yellow , totally red .
uh , so it 's visible .
uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said .
maybe it 's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long .
but to give him the shape of your hand , so you { disfmarker } it 's easier to use or something like that .
but that 's just an idea .
and then , i 'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control .
the battery , there are few options .
uh , i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery .
so , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket .
or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch .
when you uh shake it a few times , it it 's loaded .
uh , the the form of the remote control , i think it 's also nice { gap } have it curved .
and maybe like it 's hand-shaped .
uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .
uh material , you use plastic .
hard plastic uh because uh { gap } it wo n't have to burst uh like in the { disfmarker } in one time .
and also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
uh the push-buttons .
we have one new thing uh discovered .
it 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse .
maybe it 's uh easy to use uh for the channels .
when you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wan na see the next , uh if you wan na see that channel .
and also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it 's also uh easy to use .
just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down .
and that 's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here .
you can do it with your thumb .
and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons and and this one has to be soft .
for the young peoples i think scroll button 's good .
