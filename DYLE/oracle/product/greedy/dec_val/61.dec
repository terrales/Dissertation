well s then start .
well , the working design , and the { vocalsound } the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver .
that 's the that 's the basic idea .
well you you ca n't have any uh every button { vocalsound } under the thumb , of course .
yeah but with with the l_c_d_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
{ vocalsound } we have a power button , setting buttons , l_c_d_ window , the number buttons { disfmarker }
