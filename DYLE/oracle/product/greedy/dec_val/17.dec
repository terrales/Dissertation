which is kind of fun .
and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued as in within the team or ?
so is this all we need to get through ?
well huh .
an interesting day all in all i would say .
though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .
there 's a guy studying it here , yeah , he 's studying ums and ahs or something .
