uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the l_c_ display .
but you 've got a lot less control over it .
looking at what we 've got , we we want an l_c_d_ display with a spinning wheel .
but it 's it it 's more time-consuming .
buttons .
just spinning and not scrolling , i would say .
which i 'll presume he 'll work out what that means .
um the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation .
and as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we 've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .
