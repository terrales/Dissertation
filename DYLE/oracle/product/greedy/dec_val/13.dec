'cause we were thinking { disfmarker } oh yeah look at that .
i can plug you in .
but { disfmarker } yeah i like that , i like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .
the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism .
{ vocalsound } i appear to have lost my microphone .
mm .
{ vocalsound } right um we do n't have many people { vocalsound } or there 's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool .
um right .
i guess we 've c we 've touched on most of this .
the idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates .
um .
the thing with { disfmarker } i see { vocalsound } would there not be a { vocalsound } we 'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?
yeah the { vocalsound } the fashion we put fashion into electronics .
think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .
people are n't gon na want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .
if it comes from above .
they just want it to be on and ready to go .
to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode .
