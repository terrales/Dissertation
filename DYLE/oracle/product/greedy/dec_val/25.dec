and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we 'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are n't compatible with that .
but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then see if we can cut some corners .
i think we might have to drop the voice rec .
we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
it could still have the basic buttons on it .
um , 'cause we 're going for basic functionality primarily as well .
like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here true ,
