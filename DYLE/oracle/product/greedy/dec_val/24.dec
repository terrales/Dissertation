i 'll go first .
okay .
um , but worth a shot .
no problem .
{ vocalsound } on the remote control at the { gap } { vocalsound } and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line .
uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .
um , and of course our voice command system which i 've talked a little bit about already and uh that is about it .
i thought there was some flexibility with that .
we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
well what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , we 're still not making it easier then .
fair enough .
so that would n't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the { gap } thing .
