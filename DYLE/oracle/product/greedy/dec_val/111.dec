so uh we discussed an { disfmarker } { vocalsound } excuse me .
so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells uh it 's { disfmarker } i think in manufacturing i guess it 's problematic .
so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesser { disfmarker } uh re really less expensive compared to l_c_d_ uh { disfmarker } uh { disfmarker } and also like in { disfmarker } if you put a { gap } it 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things or did the { disfmarker } do n't touch the remote .
where each button does only one thing .
