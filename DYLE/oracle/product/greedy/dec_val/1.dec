uh okay .
{ vocalsound } { vocalsound } so n uh with uh with regard to the { vocalsound } uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh i 've identified um { vocalsound } a few basic uh components of the remote and uh { vocalsound } se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w i c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .
{ vocalsound } { vocalsound } so { vocalsound } { vocalsound } this is the method that uh i 'll mostly be following in my um { vocalsound } in my uh role .
um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since i 'm dealing only with the technical aspects , i would need feedback from the marketing person uh and { vocalsound } uh from the user interface person .
uh we 'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level um well , i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , yep , cool .
okay , functional requirements .
i think we need both .
