what is going on ?
big one , they are uh not easy to use .
um i have one set and uh a remote control , when i dropped it , uh it broke .
so that wo n't be uh our goal , i think .
big buttons , positive .
all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo n't know what they 're working for .
and that it controls the channels and the the volume .
and uh i i i think it 's positive if there 's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote .
so that you know it s it still has batteries on it { disfmarker } in it .
and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it 's working .
and uh yeah .
uh { disfmarker } no battery use .
so more ideas ?
