is the penultim meeting .
{ vocalsound } { vocalsound } yep .
so we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface .
for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities .
first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use { vocalsound } traditional solar cells or { disfmarker } mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ and this push buttons uh yeah so { disfmarker } we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo i mean we 're { gap } we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money no , the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .
now let 's talk about uh interface .
too much concept .
uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .
just they 'll get few more things and few more colours .
{ vocalsound } and that makes me special .
{ gap } be an option , but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
yeah , marketing expert .
so anyway uh next slide please .
{ vocalsound } uh to be to be quick { vocalsound } there 's a lot of words here but uh basically there are { disfmarker } uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very { disfmarker } pay much attention to .
the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel .
and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing .
it has to be fancy .
strangely enough it 's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that 's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , or at least { disfmarker } we want to follow general trend .
but seems it 's the trend .
okay , okay .
in fact i just agreed to make uh to make the { disfmarker } like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .
yeah , yeah , that { disfmarker } user friendly
