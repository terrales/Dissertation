you said uh targ target groups , so we need to { disfmarker } yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on yep , cool .
okay , functional requirements .
it 's working .
so what i have , wh where i 've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .
um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know .
what 's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and l_c_d_ screens in remote control .
not that they actually gave me any answers on the l_c_d_ screens , so i should have taken that bit out , but anyway .
'cause i thought they 'd be more exciting .
um but { disfmarker } seventy six point three percent .
{ vocalsound } but yeah .
um so i mean like it is an age group to target , really , i think .
because actually i mean they 're all still re young people .
yeah .
okay , i think we 're gon na have to wrap this up um .
but if we go away with that that kind of general um { vocalsound } specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option it should be on your desktop , so on the { disfmarker } no , they 're all called something slightly different .
technical requirements and something something , yeah .
components ,
