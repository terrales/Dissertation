works for me .
the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ right um { vocalsound } the industrial designer but i happen to love it , maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .
i think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .
i like the idea of the uh multi plate .
{ gap } something , are they ?
i dunno .
