some extra deciding .
of course .
you had some very strange layout .
uh it 's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting .
with uh the different uh perspectives of it .
uh we 'll begin uh with the front .
we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape .
um with uh the upper part being the front .
th so there 's this part um { vocalsound } which is made of hard plastic , the front .
and uh we 're we 're using different colours .
of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , but basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark .
fancy colours .
{ vocalsound } um then we have uh the lower part { vocalsound } of the of the device .
uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it 's also titanium .
you can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look .
um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , channel up and volume ?
and how large is it ?
uh any other suggestions ?
yeah , the fourteen yeah .
the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?
are the functions easy to learn ?
are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?
yes .
well , look at the costs at this point .
then we go to fourteen point six .
one and a half euros .
hmm ?
so we have to make it cheaper .
pro project .
{ vocalsound } uh leadership next .
well uh they they did n't think of the requirements .
{ vocalsound } it was a complete disaster .
or not ?
that one .
communicate in between .
