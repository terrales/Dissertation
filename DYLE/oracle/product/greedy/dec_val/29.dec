um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the l_c_d_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .
that 's over on the interface , go on .
in that case .
solar panels with the rubber .
flat on the top .
yeah .
uh um we we 're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as l_c_d_s , mm .
and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one 's the little bit inside the wheel ,
