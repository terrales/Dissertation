it 's the technical function or the functional requirements .
project .
the battery .
you say one battery is cheaper .
why ?
you 're the project manager .
{ vocalsound } that 's clear .
{ vocalsound } okay thank you .
so now the user interface designer .
uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .
it 's about discussion we had earlier .
um { disfmarker } you can find most functions on a t_v_ set .
so uh you do n't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .
and such things .
um well the design is very important .
one thing i did not say i think , is that a lot of users also said then i would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one .
but they found most remote controls very ugly .
so the design of our remote control is very important .
and uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .
that were my findings .
yeah .
i have uh one question .
maybe we should first have a discussion about that .
so , it 's not my requirement .
then uh { disfmarker } well a power button ?
mute .
maybe in the menu ?
