okay .
so welcome back .
a little later but here it is .
not much .
'kay .
that 's clear .
{ vocalsound } okay thank you .
so now the user interface designer .
{ vocalsound } um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh { disfmarker } for a remote control to to to have some influence on the t_v_ set .
uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way .
no cords attached .
and uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote .
that was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting .
uh i find some uh some interesting quotes on the web .
uh well the same idea here .
uh message to the television .
and uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh { disfmarker } and maybe uh teletext or something like that .
uh well these are two uh remotes , and that 's our uh our dilemma i think .
uh { disfmarker } we just heard from the industrial designer how uh difficult it is .
but uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .
or uh uh more functions on the remote .
uh maybe more devices you can influence .
uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh v_c_r_ .
{ vocalsound } yeah well that 's our dilemma .
um any ideas about that ?
basic or multifunctional ?
