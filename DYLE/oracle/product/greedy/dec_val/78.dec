industrial designer .
interface concept .
uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .
not with an l_c_d_ .
yeah but young people have to have all their uh room .
and mostly they are smaller .
so { disfmarker } to get a feeling for this .
well , uh then already come to my personal preferences .
we uh aim at the younger market .
so , we should also be uh look at their uh trends .
however , with trends it 's always if there 's { disfmarker } it 's now .
it it it might last one year , and next year it be { disfmarker } uh can be totally different .
and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year .
so , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year .
so , that 's uh one thing to keep in mind .
with the scroll button .
and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .
no , no , no .
i mean the the shape of the remote control .
your problem .
not mine .
so we use a normal battery .
depends on the scroll .
but that 's { disfmarker } okay .
then this is the design .
and the buttons are on the next page .
so , depends on the cost .
so , more .
seven .
see you at the next meeting .
