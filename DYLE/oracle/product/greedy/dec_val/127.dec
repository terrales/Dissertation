because they are supposed to be useful .
{ vocalsound } do n't forget about that .
so we 've we 've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and i 'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .
and next please .
yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user do n't like in remote controls .
first of all , they find it very ugly .
{ vocalsound } current remote controls as you know they 're the same as this one uh they 're not nice colour , not nice shape , i mean they 're all the same , and they 're not l good looking .
um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were { disfmarker } people are ready to pay for nice and look { disfmarker } and fancy looking uh remote control , so i think we should probably spend lots of time in { disfmarker } and effort in that um .
and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it { disfmarker } the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .
for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another .
and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so i think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .
um next please .
{ vocalsound } now { vocalsound } people are very frustrated w with their { vocalsound } remote controls uh you are a market expert no , in no not only speech , yeah .
did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?
it just beeps .
