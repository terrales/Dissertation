okay .
right .
that 's page one of my presentation .
so the uh method .
we 're gon na have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project .
um remote control works as follows .
this is all pretty basic stuff you guys .
um sends message to another system , so there 's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there 's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .
a user interface controls the chip , basically that 's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .
so my findings , um i just did a preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .
um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there 's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that 'd be really bad .
yeah sorry i could n't get that g to use before .
oh that would be perfect .
thank you .
slide show up and running .
do they ?
okay .
for now .
but apparently not .
