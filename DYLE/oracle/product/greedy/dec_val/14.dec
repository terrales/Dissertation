well .
uh , we have assembled our prototype , um .
what 's to be said about it ?
um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um .
some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see this was actually an apple on the inside .
and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .
a bit over budget , um .
of what to do .
which was what the whole project was about you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .
uh i think they still do their job .
kind of .
and they were just empty .
like with those words already on it ?
