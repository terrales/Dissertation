go ahead .
so we 'll have to look into that .
a different shape no problem .
{ vocalsound } lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team { vocalsound } on the remote control yeah .
very true , very true .
and uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your { disfmarker } for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i { disfmarker } again if we go with touch screen i do n't think that 's a big issue .
um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .
and uh that is about it .
but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then you discussed either a lithium or a solar power .
would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ?
or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?
true ,
