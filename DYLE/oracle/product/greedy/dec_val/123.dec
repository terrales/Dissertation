well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
the group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables .
but they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that .
and also they like curved round shapes .
so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want .
and if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .
but uh since we do n't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do n't really have to consider that .
i think as you know something uh some devices like this .
and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .
this is just crazy .
too expensive ?
alright .
but uh we should decide now .
so material , um hard plastic for the front ?
yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
the chip is normal silicon .
yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them ,
