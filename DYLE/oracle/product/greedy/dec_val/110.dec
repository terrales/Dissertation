yep .
so we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface .
for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities .
first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use { vocalsound } traditional solar cells or { disfmarker } mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ the cost .
{ disfmarker } we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo i mean we 're { gap } we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .
just uh for output , yeah .
now let 's talk about uh interface .
not the case .
{ gap } be an option , i dunno , that might be expensive that are also { disfmarker } yeah .
uh we will try to explore these two options
