i have to do working design so uh you just control the { disfmarker } but still { disfmarker } yeah .
so it would be { disfmarker } and then { disfmarker } and well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .
even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it { disfmarker } different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they do n't touch the remote and mm y you do n't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off control , because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .
yeah .
i think that could be in the component uh concept uh .
