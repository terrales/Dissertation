right , i am going to tell you something about the components design .
uh again i have uh put up the specification properties .
this uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device .
and the materials ?
um i have heard several things , so i uh i 'll have to change that on the way .
but uh the case ?
uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic .
but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong .
and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .
um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons .
no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .
and , uh as we agreed , we do n't use a speaker or a sensor or um { vocalsound } uh speak uh speech uh controlled { vocalsound } device .
uh soft enough .
young people love them .
{ vocalsound } uh s solid , no not on the front ,
