he talks about something on the components design after having put up the specification properties .
as for materials , he used to suggest using hard plastic in order to make the control hard and solid , but at this conference , he thinks that their target audience , young people , love soft colors and materials , like rubber .
and he also suggests a shape of a double curved case .
as for the buttons , he suggests simple push buttons , without difficult scroll things that makes the control more complex and expensive .
and he suggests not using a speaker or a sensor or speech controlled device .
