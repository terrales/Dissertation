the group found that if they would use the touch screen as well as the voice recognition technique , the cost would up to 17 euros .

provided that they would control the cost within 12.5 euros , they would have to cut off some functions , for example , voice recognition .
it was really hard to balance between the popular tastes , the cost and the quality .
