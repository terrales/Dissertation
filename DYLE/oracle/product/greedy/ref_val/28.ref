this meeting was about technical design .
firstly , the group had three presentations on remote components , user interface and market trends .
they presented remote control features including the circuit board , the chip , the kinetic energy , the interface mechanism of operation , the scroll wheel to be added as well as the lcd and spinning innovation .
then , the group had a discussion about the key remote concepts .
they decided to have a lcd display with a spinning wheel .
they would not have hand dynamos , instead , they would have a wind dynamo .
and they would keep the kinetic energy as an option and look at more spongy material preferences with rubber or plastic .
