the user interface proposed to give up the idea of a hand-held model and give its way to the voice recognition system , while the industrial design thought it would be necessary for remote control to be able to be held in hand .
industrial design believed that not all the people would always use the voice recognition system and most of the time they have to take it by hand .
for most , voice recognition is only a kind of addition .
if the remote control was not in a suitable shape , like something round , it would bring some troubles .
