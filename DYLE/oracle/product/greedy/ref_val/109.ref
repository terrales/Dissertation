the meeting was mainly about conceptual design .
in the beginning , the group focused on industrial components : energy , material and interface .
the industrial designer preferred traditional batteries , titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition .
after that , the group talked about lcd display and locating methods .
the second topic was user interface concept , which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons .
the group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs .
to make a smart controller , they mentioned speech recognition and user identification .
when it came to trend watching , the marketing put forward three noteworthy aspects - being fancy , technologically innovative and useful .
the group agreed to follow the trend but the specific design was not decided .
