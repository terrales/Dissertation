the industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source , an interface which included some pressing buttons and keys , a processor , some infrared source which could send the information to the main device , and different encryption codes for different tvs .
since the marketing and the user interface designer mentioned speech recognition , the industrial designer also took that into account .
all these components would cost 5 euros or even less than that .
as for gesture recognition and automatic power control , the group gave them up due to price issues .
at the end of the meeting , the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller .
