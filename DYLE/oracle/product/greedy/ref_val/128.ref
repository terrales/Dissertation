after conducting a survey , the marketing found power button was not used often because users used it only once per session while the channel selection was very often used which made it quite important .
volume was not often used but people wanted to have control on volume and that made sense .
what much less often used was the settings , such as audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
