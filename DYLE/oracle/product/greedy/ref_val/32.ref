they decided to implement a lcd display with a scroll wheel .
instead of using hand dynamos , the group decided to use a wind dynamo which was more environmentally friendly .

at last , groupmates agreed to apply interchangeable cases with incorporated colours to make the remote more trendy .
they would use a simple battery , the advanced chip , a curved side case and rubber buttons .
