the industrial designer introduced the prototype of the product .
it had not only the round basic shape which was made of hard plastics and titanium using different colors , but also the channel and volume buttons and so on .

on the side view , the product had the titanium colour and the logo was in the upper corner .
then the buttons like `` okay '' , `` volumn '' and `` channel '' , was with kind of arrow shapes , which made it more exciting than basic round or square buttons .
