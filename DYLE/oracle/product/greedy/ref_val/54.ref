marketing did a usability lab-test with a hundred people and found that users disliked the ugly look of current remote controls and the market segmentation includes different attitudes towards new functions .
users felt it hard to learn new functions and they zapped a lot .
the channel switch was the most popular function while the power , volume and channel selections buttons were very relevant .
the market was to be segmented to different groups and most users were between thirty-six and forty-five years old and young users had different tastes about the lcd compared to the old .
the speech recognition features were welcomed by the second largest group , the young but which group they should targeted remained to be discussed .
marketing concluded that less important functions should be discarded and the device should be user friendly .
