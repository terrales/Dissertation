the meeting was basically on functional design .
first , the marketing talked about the user requirements based on a market survey and suggested making their new product good-looking and equipped with less buttons and a speech recognition system .
then the user interface designer stressed that they should design nothing but a remote control because their principle was to make users ' simple desires into simple actions .
therefore , the proposed concept for design included just a few buttons , a screen with a back light and titanium , which was accepted by the group .
finally , when it came to the working design of the remote control , the industrial designer described the product as a portable device with some energy source , an interface , a processor , some infrared source , different encryption codes for different tvs , and speech recogniser .
all these components would be within budget .
at the end of the meeting , the group also talked about how to enable the users to find the controller .
