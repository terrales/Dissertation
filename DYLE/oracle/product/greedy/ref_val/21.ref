the whole meeting was about a detailed prototype of the remote control .
as before , this meeting also began with personal presentations .
the industrial design focused on the components of the remote control , including the energy source , the buttons and the materials , while the user interface suggested to use voice recognition technique and add secured or hidden programming onto the touch screen .
then the problem came that if they would like to make it so complex , they would go beyond the budget and have to raise the cost .
thus they decided to simplify some functions and buttons .
before the meeting ended , they also discussed the shape of the remote control .
