the marketing thought they needed to evaluate whether it made sense to do the project and whether the product could fulfil their requirement .
so the group started to judge the design on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being false .
the criteria were fanciness , technology , robustness , usefulness , size and weight , colour and shape , and adaptiveness .
the product got an average score of two point one seven , which implied it was good .
