to follow the trend of fruit and vegetable , there were two options : something in titanium and smelling like fruit , or something spongy and fruity-like .
the industrial designer would explore these two choices and he also suggested having two different assemblies , but the project manager said they could n't have both .
the project manager also mentioned another solution - painting the controller to pretend that it was titanium .
the group did n't make a final decision .
