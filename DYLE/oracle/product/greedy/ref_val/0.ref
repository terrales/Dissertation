this meeting was about functional design .
firstly , the group had three presentations on working design , technical functions and functional requirements .
they suggested basic components of the remote control including the size , the colour , the ease of using and main buttons .
then group mates had a discussion on general requirements .
they agreed to target disposable income groups between 15 to 35 years of age group .
also , they decided to have a simple , small-sized remote with key buttons and a menu button .
lastly , they agreed to integrate the voice recognition technology because the group mates thought they should not only focus on the target age group from 15 to 25 , but also the age group from 25 to 35 .
