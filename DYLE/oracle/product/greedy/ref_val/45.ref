the project manager thought the prototype was basically the same with the former one , and the thickness was not suitable for the target customers .
then the lcd screen might be covered when held by hands , so the users could n't figure out what happened on the screen .
therefore from this perspective the screen was totally unusable , still needing marketing research .
