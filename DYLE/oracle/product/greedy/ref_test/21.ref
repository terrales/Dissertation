the team planned to do touch screen and there are two options to choose from , a bare pcb circuit board which could be in different colours and making a connection by the touch of fingers , and anti rsi rubber buttons with a lcd type of screen .
industrial designer doubted whether a lcd screen is wanted as it would only be in black and white but have not thought out how to distinguish where to press if the bare pcb circuit board is used .
