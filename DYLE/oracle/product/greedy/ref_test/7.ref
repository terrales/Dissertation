this is the fourth meeting of the design group .
the group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting .
then project manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget , they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells , not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics .
then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product .
they thought the remote control should be fancy , innovative , easy to use , easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria .
when evaluating the project , the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price .
eventually , the group decided to redesign the product .
