the team decided to make a single-curved remote control with colourful rubber .
it would be powered by traditional batteries and solar .
they would also add a scroll-wheel with some additional buttons .
in addition , corporate identity should be embodied so the colours could be black and yellow .
as they decided not to use an lcd display , a regular chip would be selected .
