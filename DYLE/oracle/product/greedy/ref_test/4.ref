since user interface initially suggested less button feature on the remote control , so project manager suggested a telly screen like what phones have .
and user interface mentioned about the master control in electronic houses .
however , user interface thought it is a bit expensive to create this feature , but marketing mentioned the similar screen in phones is in the acceptable cost range .
so , project manager agreed and suggested further discussion in the coming meeting .
