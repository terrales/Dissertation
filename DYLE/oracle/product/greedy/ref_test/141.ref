this was a meeting on the detailed design .
first , the user interface designer presented a prototype to show the basic colour and shape of the product .
next , the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it , so the group started to judge the design in three aspects : how fancy , technologically innovative , and easy-to-use the remote control was .
it got three , two , and four in separate aspects , which meant the design was acceptable .
later , the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget .
furthermore , they came up with some new ideas about future products , such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable tv that followed the trend and people 's moods .
finally , the group named the product as pineapple remote control .
