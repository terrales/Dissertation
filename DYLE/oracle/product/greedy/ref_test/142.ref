the user interface designer put forward that the basic colour would be red and yellow and there would be two basic shapes - circle and triangle , which was called a mushroom design .
specifically , the prototype had 3 key features - a fuzzy look , a spherical channel selection and a stable triangle base .
however , the marketing thought mushroom was not in the trends so the group decided to change it into a pineapple .
