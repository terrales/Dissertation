project manager introduced a new remote control project .
the team started to know each other by drawing favourite animals .
project manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 euros , considering the 12.5-euro production cost .
the market range would be international and over all age groups .
after the financial targets , the team discussed the remote design .
despite the `` one-for-all '' style , the remote was still supposed to be user-friendly .
standard features such as sorting through channels and adjusting volume would not lose their priority .
the team , therefore , agreed on a style of basic buttons with a self-intuitive screen menu .
silver lightweight plastic was temporarily decided to be the material , for it is easily moulded and cost-saving .
