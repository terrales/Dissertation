this meeting was about conceptual design .
the user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - google controller , fancy controller , and intelligent controller .
the first two were approved by the project manager , but the last one was seriously questioned .
the group finally decided to mix the google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands .
the discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects â€”material , alimentation , and chip .
the industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with lcd , applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation , and using low level chips , which was agreed by the group .
the marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis .
users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative .
at the same time , being user-friendly was also important .
then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice .
