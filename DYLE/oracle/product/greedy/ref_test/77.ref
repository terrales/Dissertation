the project manager put forward that the speech recognition would n't work when several persons wanted to change the channel at the same time , and the cost would surely rise if adding the two technologies .
in response to that , the user interface designer said they would just cooperate with some research institute and the vocabulary was limited , so it would n't cost much .
then the project manager posed the language problem .
the user interface designer answered they would have some language adaptations so the product could be used by people from all countries .
finally , there were still problems with the microphone and camera that were necessary for the two technologies .
