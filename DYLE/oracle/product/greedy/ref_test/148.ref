the group decided that the product would have a low level chip , one button with lcd , a scroll wheel with a push button on it , a battery in the base , a single curve , and solar cells and it would be plastic instead of wooden so that the costs were 12.5 euros which was within the budget .
furthermore , they came up with some new ideas about future products , such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable tv that followed the trend and people 's moods .
