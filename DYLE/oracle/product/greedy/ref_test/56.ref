industrial designer thought some parts needed custom design , and other parts should just use standard .
for example , the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator , and the circuit board needed custom design as well , while the buttons and the wheels , radio sender and receiver were all standard parts .
in addition , beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote .
rubber , plastic , wood and titanium were options of materials , but better not titanium .
regular chips were required if the ipod-style wheel button was used .
