the discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects â€”material , alimentation , and chip .
the industrial designer suggested using wood instead of plastic to make the controller more fashionable and having buttons with lcd so that people could see the controller in dark .
in terms of the alimentation , it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation .
considering that the product was supposed to be easy to use , the industrial designer thought some low level chip would be enough , which was agreed by the group .
