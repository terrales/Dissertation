the team mainly planned the remote control project down to the last detail in the final meeting .
industrial designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top lcd touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom .
there would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization .
inside the remote control , there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery .
the team was under the budget at present .
once the budget increased , however , the voice recognition would be incorporated .
the remote control 's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members , but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough .
all members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership .
