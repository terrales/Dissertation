this was a functional design meeting .
based on the presentations of the user interface designer , the industrial designer and the marketing expert , the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful , easy to use , fashionable , recognizable , only for television and internet-connected .
after discussing the industrial design of the product , the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller with less buttons but whether the product would be wireless was still unsolved .
as for the product appearance , the group decided to make the product look fancy and recognizable ; nevertheless , they had different opinions on the colour of the product .
