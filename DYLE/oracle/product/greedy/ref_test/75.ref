the user interface designer introduced three concepts in the user interface - google controller , fancy controller , and intelligent controller .
the three meant that the product would be simple but powerful , attractive and recognizable , and loaded with speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology .
the first two were approved by the project manager , but the last one was seriously questioned .
after a lot of discussions , the group finally decided to mix the google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands .
