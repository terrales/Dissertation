project manager thought his leadership was crap personally and he never did a management position .
while industrial designer thought project manager did tell them when to start and when to end , which was important in good leadership .
and user interface thought project manager did a good job in leadership because they did n't have set roles so much , which was a democratic process .
marketing supplemented that everyone got blended quite well .
