industrial designer desired to integrate remote controls for different appliances into one .
marketing pointed out that such integration would lead to too many buttons , which was not user-friendly enough .
instead , marketing suggested that a menu display should be incorporated .
project manager and user interface agreed and added that basic buttons could remain .
user interface and industrial designer refused the flip top , however , for it costs a lot .
the team temporarily chose lightweight plastic to be the material .
