the user interface designer thought it was easier than a traditional controller because you did n't have to press a button , just turn the ball to a certain angle to select channels .
however , the marketing and the industrial designer thought it was quite difficult because users did n't know the angle was the correct one and they had to go through all the channels if they wanted to jump from channel one to twenty .
