the user interface drew a draft for the group to get a more direct idea about the button layout .
through a brief discussion , they agreed that as long as they made the button clear enough to be recognized , it would not matter much where the exact button was .
the group also thought about a remote control which was able to be folded , in order to test if it would be strong enough to stand hit .
