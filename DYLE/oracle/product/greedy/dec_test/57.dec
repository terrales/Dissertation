you need a screen for it ?
you need a screen with music because you 're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever .
with t_v_ channels it 's , you know , one two three .
so { disfmarker } graphical interface ?
they have to r wheel really fast .
at least on theirs .
it 's more expensive according to the design people .
to { disfmarker } i 'm not sure .
it sounds like this remote 's going to be purchased separately from the television , maybe a ball .
and { disfmarker } yeah you could squish it .
that was me .
was that you ?
