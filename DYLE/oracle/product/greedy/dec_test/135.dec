okay well um .
so our design looks something like this .
this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu .
and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
so you can change the colour , according to your { disfmarker } to suit your living room or whatever .
and it comes { disfmarker } um evaluation criteria .
i 've got a presentation .
our animals will forever be there .
