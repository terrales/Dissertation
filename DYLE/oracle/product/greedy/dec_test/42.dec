no , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects .
but personally i would n't like a sponge as a remote control .
but { disfmarker } maybe soft material or something .
but not a real sponge .
user interface um that 's okay .
but the front , on which the the buttons are does n't have to be rubber .
and we 've decided not to use l_c_d_ .
