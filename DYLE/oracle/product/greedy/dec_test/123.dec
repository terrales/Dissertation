come on .
there we are .
i i was gon na make a cat too .
it 's not that cool as i th thought it would be .
just { disfmarker } so a lot of buttons { vocalsound } on the remote control .
well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , { gap } { disfmarker } we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter .
{ vocalsound } um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons .
um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh { vocalsound } use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
just big enough for the buttons we have , that 's that 's it .
where you can see uh more options .
i think { disfmarker } just to put it on your television and just s recharge , uh it has to lay good in the hand , n uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
so it does n't matter what place it is on the remote control i think , so you can do something unique with that .
it did n't say that .
