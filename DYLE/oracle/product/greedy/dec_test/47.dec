i 'll go over what we decided last meeting , yep there we go .
okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable .
so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ to make make it as simple as possible .
and to summarise i i would say it 's { disfmarker } it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering { gap } maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will { gap } this two features together .
so what the concept is to have a flip-top model .
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you { disfmarker } you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .
so it 's like { disfmarker } it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh { disfmarker } added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .
findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it 's not { disfmarker } of no use of punching in the uh { disfmarker } trying to put in those things in { disfmarker } on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user .
as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ?
yeah , so in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .
{ vocalsound } anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
trendy kind of a thing .
i think we have to design one product um , something like that should reduce the size of it .
so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your { disfmarker } can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i have n't missed anything .
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus .
and we 've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .
for detection , right .
