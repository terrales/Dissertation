functional requirements , yeah yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
so we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .
sorry i thought about it , yes .
okay , this was uh my presentation .
it 's on the on the uh net net uh thing , yeah , i have it on the next page .
when { disfmarker } not anymore for t_v_ .
most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu .
okay .
well , the working design .
the method i used is uh search the web .
just the web page provided .
um { disfmarker } basically i 'm i 'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh i could figure it out .
um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .
and by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed .
so like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh { disfmarker } then the chip produces a pattern .
like a morse code to uh { disfmarker } and and sends that to the uh l_e_d_ .
that 's the uh light emitting diode , i think .
um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light .
that 's un uh invisible to the human eye .
and uh transmit that uh to the t_v_ .
however it has also an uh a visible uh diode that 's uh blinking red if you look in it .
and that 's uh another diode , i believe .
it 's just to indicate something 's on .
so it uh { disfmarker } we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .
because you have to { disfmarker } that 's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .
and then um it 's working .
yeah .
yeah , and this is a led too .
to make it more like a mobile phone .
more modern .
different colours .
okay , o but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .
because you ne almost never use it .
