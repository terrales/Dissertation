interface ?
for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very { disfmarker } so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so .
no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field .
well y y you have also the language problem , yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or { disfmarker } a microphone maybe .
well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .
{ vocalsound } no one would would be interested .
so .
the { disfmarker } then nn but you have to think , the user is the one who gon na buy the product two ?
or will it be a battery like the classical battery so .
and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use .
so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
but still y uh and what about the user interface concept ?
uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested adding some vocal commands .
