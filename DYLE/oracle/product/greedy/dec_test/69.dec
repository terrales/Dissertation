now , who would like to go next ?
so simplification of symbols you could think of .
mm-hmm .
menu , alright .
so you 've got a little l_c_d_ display .
right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
right .
right .
so that 's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with ,
