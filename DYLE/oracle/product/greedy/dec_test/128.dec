marketing expert .
so , baba is the uh the industrial designer .
okay .
i think it 's cheaper than laser , so { vocalsound } .
design a wireless remote control .
{ vocalsound } so it 's it 's interesting information , i think .
and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so { disfmarker } does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on .
so we should change this as well .
and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well .
and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
and uh this is one of the main point for me .
but i 'll come back to it later .
'kay .
could you go next slide ?
uh , so as you said uh , so lets you { disfmarker } then you have less buttons .
because different people have a different opinion about fancy .
you know .
okay .
but there 's balance between function and the cost .
and that 's it .
