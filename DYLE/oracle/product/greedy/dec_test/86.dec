like in terms of it 's easy to implement .
yeah you click the button , it 's gon na send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it 's not gon na work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
it would have to be sold separately because if the sender 's on the remote then you 'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote { vocalsound } .
so it 's now like a two-part thing .
i think that 's what the phone has ,
