but it 's not that fancy .
was it one of our options ?
the remote control offers enough features .
well , the basic layout does n't offem { disfmarker } offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot .
so { disfmarker } yeah , but { vocalsound } it ha does n't has the digits .
i believe it 's { disfmarker } if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , i do n't i do n't think it is { disfmarker } it has all the features um a normal remote has .
so high quality , low acceptance .
and and that was the the big deal .
i if we knew that before , we c we could have made okay .
i thought it was quite a handy uh thing , in interesting design .
