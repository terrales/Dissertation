{ gap } { vocalsound } no .
okay well { disfmarker } i received an email { disfmarker } okay .
i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it .
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
so it 's very important for us to create something new .
so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
uh it came out of the research .
it uh is twice important as the following .
{ vocalsound } the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
and then uh that uh { disfmarker } this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh l_c_d_ or uh speech recognition .
yeah .
okay .
that was this ?
yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .
but it { disfmarker } that 's on on the display .
they 're on top ?
still still transparent .
um the buttons .
normal rubber i think .
like normal ordinary buttons .
soft .
yeah , the normal infrared l_e_d_ i think s sufficient .
and back light l_e_d_s .
uh but we have to do something about the trend .
we already know that .
just a normal battery .
and we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .
{ gap } and a flashy light .
user interface concept .
yeah , and the led .
yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .
do we have to design that w as well ?
