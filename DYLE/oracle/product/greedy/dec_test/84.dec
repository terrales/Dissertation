'kay so we 'll try to zip through this , since we 're short on time .
welcome everybody .
um hope your sessions went well .
um so this is our functional design meeting , we 're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
um i 've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings { vocalsound } { vocalsound } , and i 'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there 's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .
um i i 'll get the ones up for next time , um they 're not finished yet .
right .
um so can we have updates from everyone from what you 've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you 'd like to share or discuss in this { disfmarker } 'kay .
what 's function ?
okay .
so the { disfmarker } so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , and screen .
that 's only for speech recognition and screen .
i guess .
so we definitely want a power button and numbers .
right .
you know actually our our new project requirements , i 'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things .
okay .
so like if we had that { disfmarker } but i mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .
