sorry project manager { vocalsound } .
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later .
so that was one of the first things we did .
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .
{ vocalsound } uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
they can t but there 'd be touch touch buttons , we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
