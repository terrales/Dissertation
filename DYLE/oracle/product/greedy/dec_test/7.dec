uh yellow with uh the basic { disfmarker } okay .
okay .
um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum .
if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um { vocalsound } to make it { vocalsound } just between the twelve euro fifty , um then i did the following changes .
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , so the button we can use plastic .
this is the wrong one .
so uh that means redesign .
{ vocalsound } we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product .
but it 's not that fancy .
no , we are evaluating this this uh design now .
this prototype .
is it easy to use ?
and a three ?
{ vocalsound } is it easy to find ?
{ vocalsound } right , well .
the feel of the remote control is spongy .
well , uh uh twenty five .
and costs were twelve fifty .
so we could we we could be { disfmarker } we could 've been creative .
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
not at all .
