so in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design .
mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
you do n't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it .
they want it to be trendy and you would n't automatically assume { disfmarker } associate that with the older generations .
but just to have that function would be would be really good .
because we 're focusing on that , rechargeable with a docking station .
okay so we 've got a flip-screen .
slightly curved , curved .
then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think .
i think it 's a really nice idea our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus .
