okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire .
yeah the the { disfmarker } we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we did n't differentiate .
would you prefer an l_c_d_ screen , that 's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ?
yeah , uh maybe to { disfmarker } as uh { disfmarker } it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .
maybe for u_s_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control but just to have that function would be would be really good .
our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus .
for detection , right .
