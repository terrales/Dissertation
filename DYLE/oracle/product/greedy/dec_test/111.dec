yeah , but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
{ vocalsound } so this is the first stage of the evaluation .
now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .
so it 's what we 've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here .
the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those { disfmarker } the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .
okay .
uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
