okay .
how does this work ?
i dunno .
{ gap } okay .
so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly { gap } that 's what we 're going to design .
uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important .
we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting .
the the second thing is the conceptual design , that 's what it { disfmarker } that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
and we have to look what uh the market is doing for { disfmarker } what kind of uh remote controls are in the market .
and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever .
{ vocalsound } okay so { disfmarker } uh no , this is a { disfmarker } these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
and you already saw { disfmarker } you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
i do n't know , what time did we start this meeting , i 'm not sure .
yeah , it probably would be universal .
well { disfmarker } why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
but i do n't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .
mm .
if you if if you make to fold open it 's or also an { disfmarker } uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .
just think about it .
yeah , i also wrote down some stuff
