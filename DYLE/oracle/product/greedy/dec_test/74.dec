{ vocalsound } so let 's start our second me meeting on { vocalsound } conceptual design .
mm .
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface .
um there 's three concepts in the user interface .
so first one it 's a google controller .
the second is a fancy controller .
the last one is uh intelligent controller .
so there are three concepts in our controller .
um n next i will explain one by one , the first is google controller .
um , so i want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .
so it 's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .
uh this is a first concept of our controller .
the second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um but then w yeah , and what about the buttons ?
at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use .
so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .
yeah thi this is this would be like um and i maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
and l_c_d_ buttons .
adding some vocal commands .
simple ones ?
