i 'm no i 'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that 's what they said .
um the problem with the casing is that uh there 's quite { vocalsound } um there 's quite a few design restrictions that they 've got on the shape of the case .
if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more { disfmarker } they can they can do sort of curved shapes .
but whether whether or not { disfmarker } because we 'd have it in two separate units i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .
that could be a good idea .
very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
and g graphic user interface and the lower distance .
on the lower side .
