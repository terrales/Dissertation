so i 've been looking at the components design .
um .
mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we 'll just use standard .
um , i assume we 'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
and we 'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .
but once we come up with a design we 'll send it to the circuit people and they 'll just print it out .
um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel .
the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gon na be included in the circuit board that comes with it .
um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .
and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
so we have some material options .
um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
um , i 'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy .
um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we should n't have a rubber case .
and why not wood ?
but , were there buttons on there as well ?
was that you ?
