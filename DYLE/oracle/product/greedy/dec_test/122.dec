test .
we 're gon na make a remote control .
i just made a a simple uh presentation .
so you { gap } put some things in it .
i i was gon na make a cat too .
it 's just to get used to it .
it 's not that cool as i th thought it would be .
and uh also for the v_c_r_ and uh d_v_d_ player well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , { gap } { disfmarker } we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter .
{ vocalsound } um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons .
um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh { vocalsound } use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
where you can see uh more options .
i think { disfmarker } yeah , i think it 's much uh { disfmarker } too expensive .
yeah , maybe it would .
oh maybe that 's a good idea , if we { disfmarker } just think about it .
