i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
a remote control , like , for the flip phone .
it would n't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .
okay , and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have m maybe a g_ g_u_i_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface just go for the colours .
