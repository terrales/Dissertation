my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the t_v_ .
it 's more expensive according to the design people .
so it would have all these different options of changing i 'm not sure .
oh , okay , that would be cool .
uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,
