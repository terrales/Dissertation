i do n't think so , not yet .
second thing is { disfmarker } now what i was saying before about instead of having { disfmarker } you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over { disfmarker } if you had them close enough , that would be one option .
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an l_c_d_ type of screen { disfmarker } 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they { disfmarker } you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch it would n't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there 'd be touch touch buttons , now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , i mean { disfmarker } l_c_d_ screen .
mm-hmm .
okay .
which is another beauty of it .
okay .
the rubber .
